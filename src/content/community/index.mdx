There are many ways for buyers and sellers to connect with our team and each other. We offer opportunities for personal contact, shared interest groups, online communities, and social media platforms.

## Connect with Customer Service Directors (CSD)
These knowledgeable representatives support GSA's customers by providing assistance with inquiries, resolving problems and answering questions. They also host seminars on a variety of topics and are a source of information for customers on all of GSA's programs. Contact your agencyâ€™s representative to connect with your local CSD.
