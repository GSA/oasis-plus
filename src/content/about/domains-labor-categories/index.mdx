The contract scope is organized by domains and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes.

**Domains:**

The contract scope is organized by domains or functional groupings of related services spanning multiple NAICS codes. Domains are designed to align order requirements to qualified industry partners. Each domain is limited to the NAICS codes and associated size standards specifically listed under that domain; if you’re buying or selling work related to this domain, it must tie back to the appropriate NAICS codes.

**NAICS codes:**

NAICS is the standard used by federal statistical agencies in classifying entity establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

### ![Microscope](/images/domain-icons/research.svg) Research and Development (R&D)

This domain includes any requirements in support of R&D activities. R&D activities may be aimed at achieving either specific or general objectives. The term R&D includes basic research, applied research, and experimental development. Services include conducting R&D in: the physical, engineering and life sciences; nanotechnology; biotechnology; and social sciences and humanities.

### ![Half an earth with a seedling growing out of it](/images/domain-icons/sustainability.svg) Environmental (ENV)

This domain supports agencies in meeting their environmental requirements and streamlining the contracting process by providing a faster, more cost-efficient means to meet environmental objectives. Requirements typically involve multidisciplinary teams of scientists, engineers, and other technicians with expertise in areas such as air and water quality, climate change, asbestos contamination, remediation, ecological restoration, and environmental law. Environmental consulting could consist of support such as planning and documentation Services for the development, facilitation, and coordination of or for environmental initiatives or mandates in areas of chemical, radiological, or hazardous materials.

### ![A building with a group of people in front](/images/domain-icons/enterprise.svg) Enterprise Solutions

This domain is focused on requirements that are large-dollar, wide-reaching, and highly complex in scope often spanning multiple disciplines and/or locations, and requiring many different types of labor and expertise. It is for the procurement of highly technical, new and emerging and/or specialized mission objectives that require special management attention, and oversight because of:
- the importance to the agency mission; 
- the high-level development, operating, or maintenance costs; 
- the high risk; 
- the high return; or
- their significant role in the administration of agency-wide programs, systems, finances, property, or other resources. 

This domain also includes non-IT services in support of national security systems in accordance with 40 USC § 11103(a). By design, this domain shares overlapping NAICS with other domains within OASIS+.

The enterprise solutions domain will only be available for the Unrestricted contract family.

## Labor categories

OASIS+ labor categories align to the Office of Management and Budget’s [Standard Occupational Classification Manual 2018 [PDF, 285 pages]](https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/soc_2018_manual.pdf), which includes compensation data maintained by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Federal agencies use the Standard Occupational Classification system, a federal statistical standard, to classify workers into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, or disseminating data.
