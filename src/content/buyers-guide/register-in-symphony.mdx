OASIS+ uses [eBuy](https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/ebuy/) and OASIS+ task order solicitations must be issued via eBuy (mandatory).

GSA eBuy, a component of GSA Advantage, is an online Request for Quotation (RFQ) tool designed to facilitate the request for submission of quotations for a wide range of supplies (products) and services. eBuy ensures organizations are purchasing according to fair opportunity regulation, law, and/or governing rules. 

eBuy provides users increased transparency and integrity at both the master contract level and task order level. eBuy provides OASIS+ customers and OASIS+ contract holders an easy to use, highly secure, and efficient method to submit task order proposals, and capture information as a database of record for all stakeholders. eBuy will reduce the amount of time between order creation and award, which in turn fulfills customer requirements faster, thus decreasing the time spent on tedious tasks and allowing more time for complex decision making.

**eBuy users can (some actions may only be performed by an OCO with a DPA):**
- Review contractor information and capabilities;
- Create/release a Request for Information (RFI);
- Create/release a Request for Proposal (RFP)/solicitation; 
- Create RFI and RFP amendments; 
- Conduct Questions and Answers and monitor responses; 
- Receive offer proposals;
- Report task order award information.
