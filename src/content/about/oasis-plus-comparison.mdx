The OASIS+ family of contracts builds on the success of the OASIS and OASIS SB contracts, offering federal agencies access to highly qualified contractors for their comprehensive and complex non-IT services solutions worldwide.

<GradientBox>
###  OASIS+ will continue to: 
- Be a best-in-class contract that helps agencies meet their spend under management goals
- Provide a single solution for complex requirements
- Support multiple technical disciplines and mission spaces
- Support commercial and non-commercial acquisition
- Support all contract types, including hybrids and cost-reimbursement, at the task order level
- Allow ancillary support components, commonly referred to as other direct costs, or ODCs, at the task order level
