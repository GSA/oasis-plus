The following information is related to researching contract features — specifically, those that focus on pricing and wage rates.

## OASIS+ pricing
OASIS+ pricing is not allowed to be released to the public; however, the pricing will be available to OCO's who hold a [DPA](/buyers-guide/obtain-dpa/). Pricing (ceiling rates) will be located within the task order solicitation system, which is the [Symphony Procurement Suite](https://oasis.app.cloud.gov/) or Symphony, and is not for public sharing or release. Symphony is referred to as the OASIS+ submission portal, or OSP, in the OASIS+ RFPs and master contracts. The non-published OASIS+ ceiling rates apply only to sole source Time and Material (T&M)/Labor Hour (LH) orders and no other order type. OASIS+ pricing reflects ceiling rates based upon the highest qualified employees within a given labor category, working in the highest paid area within CONUS, on a highly complex requirement, excluding secret/top secret/secret compartmented information and OCONUS work. It is recommended that this pricing only be used in conjunction with other proposal analysis techniques at FAR 15.404-1 to ensure that the final agreed-to-price is fair and reasonable.

Pricing is determined fair and reasonable based on competition at the order level, and negotiation of pricing is highly encouraged at the task order level. 

We offer a [Pricing Intelligence Suite](https://buy.gsa.gov/pricing/) with multiple pricing resources including the contract awarded labor category plus tools, or CALC+.

## Construction wage rate requirements

Any requirement whose principal purpose, as determined by the OCO, falls under the scope of FAR part 36 — Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts, is not within the scope of OASIS+. When ancillary labor for construction, alteration and repair are included as ancillary support services within the scope of a task order for a total, integrated solution, construction wage rate requirements must be implemented in accordance with FAR subpart 22.4 and other regulatory supplements, as applicable. The OCO must identify such work in the task order solicitation and make a determination as to whether wage determinations are to be applied.

The master contract includes a list of clauses and/or provisions at Section I.1.2 that flow down to the task order level when construction, alteration, and repairs are within the scope of the task order. The OCO must incorporate any additional appropriate clauses and provisions in each task order solicitation and subsequent award when construction, alteration, and repairs are within the scope of the master contract and task order requirement. When applicable, the OCO must incorporate wage determinations subject to construction wage rate requirements in the task order award.

## Travel pricing (all order types)

Travel may be required to support the OASIS+ task order requirements. For those task orders requiring travel, the contractor must include estimated travel requirements in the task order proposal as required by the OCO. All travel must be in accordance with the FTR (as applicable) and all lodging must be at or below allowable, published lodging rates for the respective locality, unless an exception applies. The contractor is required to ensure good stewardship of travel funds, and must seek rates lower than the approved FTR lodging rates whenever possible. 

For CAF considerations for travel, refer to [Contract access fee](/buyers-guide/research-contract-features/task-orders/#contract-access-fee); CAF is applied to travel. 

## Outside the continental United States

The Department of State Standardized Regulations, or DSSR, is the controlling regulations for allowances and benefits available to all U.S. government civilians assigned to foreign areas. OCOs are authorized to select a foreign area pricing approach consistent with the DSSR tailored to their order requirements.

If a task order request for proposal, or TORFP, includes foreign area work and the OCO has not identified a preferred foreign area pricing approach, contractors may include a foreign area pricing approach consistent with the DSSR in their response to a TORFP. OCOs will determine if the approach results in a fair and reasonable price in accordance with the DSSR, FAR subpart 15.4, Contract Pricing, and FAR part 16, Types of Contracts as applicable. Upon request of the OCO, the contractor must provide data other than certified cost or pricing data (FAR 15.403-3) to support the task order proposal(s).
