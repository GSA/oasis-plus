## Introduction
Thank you for choosing the OASIS+ family of contracts to fulfill your complex, integrated multiple service needs! This suite of services contracts is available for use by agencies throughout the Federal Government, as defined in Section 2.1, who hold a Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA), as referenced in Section 3.0.

The OASIS+ contracts provide a common architecture and platform across the Federal Government for the acquisition of a full range of service requirements that integrate multiple service disciplines and ancillary services/products with the flexibility for commercial and non-commercial requirements, all contract types and pricing determined at the task order level to achieve a total solution. 

This Ordering Guide explains how the OASIS+ contracts can be used to satisfy a wide variety of services requirements. It does not address general contracting issues or concepts unless necessary for complete understanding. Online resources supporting the use of OASIS+ are available on the General Service Administration's (GSA's) [OASIS+ website](https://www.gsa.gov/oasis-plus/) and GSA's [OASIS+ Interact site](https://buy.gsa.gov/interact/community/196/activity-feed). This guide is to demonstrate just how easy OASIS+ makes the ordering process!

## Program overview
### Contract Families

OASIS+ has six separate “families” of Multi-Agency Contracts (MAC), collectively referred to as OASIS+, these include:


Unrestricted (UR)
- Total Small Business (SB)
- SBA-Certified 8(a) Small Business (8a)
- SBA-Certified HUBZone Small Business (HZ)
- SBA-Certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)
- SBA-Certified Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB)

The OASIS+ UR contracts were awarded as full and open competition. The OASIS+ SB contracts were awarded as 100% small business set-asides. The OASIS+ 8(a) program was awarded as a 100% set aside for exclusive competition among 8(a) participants, which was offered to and accepted by Small Business Administration (SBA) under SBA requirement number **IX1685025756D**.

### Ordering Period
OASIS+ is a collection of multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, of which the contract base period is five (5) years with one (1) option period of five (5) years that may extend the cumulative contract ordering period to 10 years. Task orders can be awarded under OASIS+ any time prior to the expiration of the ordering period of the master contracts. Notwithstanding, the OASIS+ IDIQ master contracts (contractor specific) can have different award dates; however, all contracts for each specific contract family have the same contract end dates (e.g., all of the Small Business contracts will end on the same date).

### Which Agencies Can Use OASIS+?

OASIS+ contracts may be used by all federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD) and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), but are not open to state and local governments at this time. See [4800.2I OGP Eligibility to Use GSA Sources of Supply and Services](https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/OGP%20Order%2048002I%20Eligibility%20Determination.pdf) for details. 

### Interagency Acquisition Applicability
Orders issued against the OASIS+ contracts are considered Interagency Acquisitions. GSA has specific statutory authority under [40 U.S.C. 501](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title%3A40%20section%3A501%20edition%3Aprelim)%20OR%20(granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title40-section501)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) to purchase supplies and non-personal services on behalf of other agencies. Therefore, the [Economy Act](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/17.502-2) does not apply to OASIS+ orders.

### Contracts Scope
The contract scope of OASIS+ is organized by Domains. The term Domain refers to a functional grouping of related services spanning multiple NAICS codes. Domains and the NAICS codes listed under the Domains are designed to align order requirements to qualified industry partners. Each Domain is limited to the NAICS codes and associated size standards specifically listed under that Domain. 

The OASIS+ contracts cover services that are: primarily noncommercial, with the allowance for commercial services task orders classified and unclassified; and within the Continental US (CONUS) and Outside the Continental US (OCONUS). All OASIS+ task orders must be within scope of the respective OASIS+ IDIQ contract for which it is awarded, provided the Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) determines the principal purpose NAICS code for the order to be one of the OASIS+ NAICS codes ([Appendix A](#)). If the OCO determines its requirement has a NAICS code outside one of the OASIS+ NAICS codes, the requirement is not within scope of OASIS+.
#### Scope for Information Technology & Non-Information Technology

Information Technology (IT), by definition, means any equipment, or interconnected system(s) or subsystem(s) of equipment that is used for the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the agency. For purposes of this definition, if the equipment is used by the agency directly or is used by a contractor under a contract with the agency that requires its use, or to a significant extent, its use in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.

IT is considered an ancillary support service or product on the Domains, and may be performed only when the service or product is integral and necessary to complete a total integrated solution. “Non-IT” includes any service or equipment that is acquired by a Contractor incidental to a contract or contains embedded IT that is used as an integral part of the service or product, but the principal function of which is not the acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. (For example, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment, such as thermostats or temperature control devices, and medical equipment where IT is integral to its operation, is non-IT).

Non-IT also includes any equipment or services related to a National Security System in accordance with [40 USC § 11103 (a)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:40%20section:11103%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title40-section11103)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true). The term “National Security System” means a telecommunications or information system operated by the Federal Government, the function, operation, or use of which involves intelligence activities, cryptologic activities related to national security, command and control of military forces, equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or, is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions, not including a system to be used for routine administrative and business applications (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications).

Non-IT may include embedded IT components including software, IT hardware, and other items and services traditionally considered IT on IT requirements.

Non-IT professional services are not considered ancillary support services. Non-IT professional services are considered to be within the primary scope of the Domains.

#### Task Orders - Scope/Services Not Allowed
OASIS+ task orders shall NOT include any of the following:
- Any requirement for Inherently Governmental Functions as defined in FAR 2.101.
- Any requirement for Personal Services as defined in FAR 2.101.
- Any requirement whose principal purpose - as determined by the OCO - falls under the scope of [FAR part 36 - Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-36). (Note: This does not preclude use of Architects and Engineers for services not required to be under FAR part 36 such as Construction Management, etc..)
- Any requirement whose principal purpose - as determined by the OCO - is in a NAICS code not listed under the corresponding Domain solicited. 

### Domains
The OASIS+ Domains available to provide a total solution to agency needs are:

<div class="oasis-2-column-image-list">
- ![Icons of people under an ascending arrow](/images/domain-icons/management.svg) Management and Advisory
- ![Microscope](/images/domain-icons/research.svg) Research and Development
- ![Half an earth with a seedling growing out of it](/images/domain-icons/sustainability.svg) Environmental
- ![Two hands holding up a cube](/images/domain-icons/logistics.svg) Logistics 
- ![Three gears](/images/domain-icons/tech.svg) Technical and Engineering

- ![A building with a group of people in front](/images/domain-icons/enterprise.svg) *Enterprise Solutions *(Only available on the OASIS+ UR IDIQ)
</div>

### Pricing

OASIS+ pricing is not allowed to be released to the public; however, the pricing will be available to OCO’s who hold a DPA. Pricing (ceiling rates) will be located within the task order solicitation system, which is the [Symphony Procurement Suite](https://oasis.app.cloud.gov/) (Symphony), and is not for public sharing or release. Symphony is referred to as the OASIS+ Submission Portal (OSP) in the OASIS+ RFPs and master contracts. The non-published OASIS+ ceiling rates apply only to sole source Time and Material (T&M)/Labor Hour (LH) orders and no other order type. OASIS+ pricing reflects ceiling rates based upon the highest qualified employees within a given labor category, working in the highest paid area within CONUS, on a highly complex requirement, excluding Secret/Top Secret/Secret Compartmented Information and OCONUS work. It is recommended that this pricing only be used in conjunction with other proposal analysis techniques at FAR 15.404-1 to ensure that the final agreed-to-price is fair and reasonable.

Pricing is determined fair and reasonable based on competition at the order level, and negotiation of pricing is highly encouraged at the task order level. 

GSA offers a [Pricing Intelligence Suite](https://buy.gsa.gov/pricing/) with multiple pricing resources including the Contract Awarded Labor Category Plus (CALC+) Tools.

### Roles and Responsibilities
#### GSA Responsibilities
GSA is responsible for award, administration, and management of the OASIS+ IDIQ contracts. Among the responsibilities GSA will meet are:

- Monitoring and evaluation of the performance against the IDIQ contract requirements by each contract holder;

    * Administration of task order award data in Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) upon task order award, if applicable.
    * Inclusion and administration of the Contract Access Fee (CAF) CLIN for the base and each option period of the task order and sufficiently funding the CAF for the life of the task order.
    * Monitoring limitations on subcontracting for each task order in accordance with [13 CFR 125.6(d)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/part-125#p-125.6(d)) “... for a multi-agency set aside contract where more than one agency can issue orders under the contract, the ordering agency must use the period of performance for each order to determine compliance.”
    * Administration of task order performance evaluation in Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), if applicable.
    * Resolving any performance issues, disputes, claims, or protests at the task order level.
    * Closing out task orders in a timely manner.
- Allowing a reasonable time for fair opportunity proposal submission.
- Responding to all Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Congressional, Inspector General, Small Business Administration, and/or the Government Accountability Office (GAO) requests for task order information.

### Benefits and Considerations

OASIS+ is flexible, easy to use, and allows ordering activities to solicit and/or award orders in a streamlined, high quality manner.
The benefits of OASIS+ include:
- Task orders that may be: 
    * Awarded against six contract families that have no contract ceiling or cap on awards;
    * For work performed in CONUS and/or OCONUS locations;
    * For complex commercial or non-commercial services;
    * For any contract type, including hybrid mix and structures of Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) types tailored to individual task order requirements;
- Open on-ramping; after the initial phase of awards, the solicitation for OASIS+ will remain continuously open, allowing potential industry partners to obtain OASIS+ contracts at any time as long as they qualify;
- Flexible/expandable Domain-based structure; ability to add Domains based on government need;
- A cumulative ordering period of 10 years;
- Technology-based ordering and market research tools;
- Access to an industrial base of highly qualified contractors;
- Ancillary services and Other Direct Costs (ODCs) defined as integral and necessary to complete a total integrated solution under a requirement are within the scope of the master contract;
- Access transactional data and data analytics for spend analysis and market research;
- Save time without having to complete the following, which have already been completed at the OASIS+ master contract level;
    * [FAR subpart 9.1](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-9.1) responsibility determinations;
    * [FAR 22.805](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/22.805) pre-award clearances (“Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Clearances”);
    * General Services Administration Manual/ Regulation [(GSAM/R) 505.303-70](https://www.acquisition.gov/gsam/505.303-70) congressional notifications; however, the ordering agency specific policies will still be applicable/required.
## Task Order issuance overview
### Step 1 - Delegation of Procurement Authority
The first requirement to solicit, evaluate, and award task orders under OASIS+ is that the Contracting Officer (CO) must obtain a DPA to become a “delegated” OCO. Only if a DPA is granted to an OCO from an OASIS+ CO may an OCO solicit and award a task order under the master contract(s). The task order OCO is the sole and exclusive government official with authority to solicit, evaluate, award, administer, and/or modify a task order under the master contract.

A DPA is not required to conduct market research into the OASIS+ program or to use Symphony to conduct market research, which includes issuing RFIs. DPA training is encouraged for any staff (Program Manager, Contract Specialist, Finance, Interns, etc.) interested in and/or administering an OASIS+ requirement and is required for any staff to register in Symphony; however, only a warranted Contracting Officer may obtain the DPA. The dates of available DPA training sessions are (anticipated to be live on the [OASIS+ website](https://www.gsa.gov/oasis-plus/), coming soon, prior to commencement of the ordering period).  

NOTE: Contract Specialists and other acquisition personnel are highly encouraged to take the DPA training course. 

To obtain an OASIS+ DPA, a CO must:

1. Be a warranted Contracting Officer as defined in FAR 2.101 Definitions; and
2. Attend OASIS+ DPA training; and 
3. Formally apply for the DPA; How to apply for a DPA TBD (anticipated to be live on the OASIS+ website, coming soon, prior to commencement of the ordering period). 

DPAs are issued to individuals; not to agencies. DPAs may be revoked at the discretion of the OASIS+ Contracting Officer(s). There is no limit on DPAs issued per agency, and individuals may repeat DPA training as often as preferred. 

#### Exception to DPA Requirement

In accordance with OASIS+ Contract Section G.2.2.1 Ordering Contracting Officer, contractor employees are authorized under [FAR subpart 51.1 Contractor Use of Government Supply Sources](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-51.1) to use OASIS+ and are considered OCOs and are not required to obtain a DPA as their authority is granted to them by a Federal Government CO administering an applicable contract (e.g., a Federally Funded Research and Development Center ([FFRDC](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/))). In order to authorize a contractor employee under FAR subpart 51.1 to use OASIS+, the Federal Government CO granting authority shall first obtain an OASIS+ DPA.

### Step 2 - Acquisition Planning Considerations
The OCO must complete acquisition planning and market research to determine whether OASIS+ meets their needs, as such the OCO must:

- Determine whether the specific requirement is within scope of OASIS+. 
- Determine if an OASIS+ Small Business or Socioeconomic Small Business can perform the requirements and set-aside for small business concerns, if applicable. 
- Determine which OASIS+ contract to issue the task order solicitation under. 

Task orders planned under OASIS+ are not exempt from [FAR Part 7 - Acquisition Planning](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-7) or [FAR Part 10 - Market Research](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-10). Agencies may have different policies, regulations, standards, etc, that should be considered in the decision to use OASIS+ to fulfill an agency requirement.

OASIS+ offers several approaches to aid the market research, such as:

- Research (or send an RFI to) OASIS+ contract holders and their capabilities within each OASIS+ contract, Domain, and NAICS code using [Symphony](https://oasis.app.cloud.gov/);
- Research (Optional scope review) for OASIS+ contract holders may be requested via [OASIS+ Scope Review](https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_6s3udkBbX9z1zee). The scope review is completed by GSA and will ensure the requirement is being placed under the appropriate OASIS+ contract. 
- Research (or send an RFI) using Market Research as a Service (MRAS), a free service offering a streamlined innovative approach to conducting RFI’s quickly and efficiently, after completing an optional [OASIS+ Scope Review](https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_6s3udkBbX9z1zee) (anticipated to be live on the [OASIS+ website](https://www.gsa.gov/oasis-plus/), coming soon, prior to commencement of the ordering period). Contact the [local GSA Customer Service Director](http://gsa.gov/csd) for assistance with MRAS. 

#### Domain and NAICS Selection

**Only one Domain and one NAICS code under one contract family must be selected.**

OASIS+ Domains each contain multiple NAICS codes. [FAR 19.102](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.102) requires the OCO to determine the appropriate NAICS code and assign one NAICS code and corresponding small business size standard in all solicitations and task orders. [FAR 19.102(b)(1)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.102) requires that the NAICS code assigned describes the principal purpose of the service being acquired. The tables in [Appendix A](#) identify the OASIS+ Domains and NAICS codes with their corresponding size standards. 

Note: In accordance with regulation, OCOs must select the task order NAICS code based upon the work to be performed and not based upon the applicable size standard or program office supported. Apparent discrepancies will be brought to the OCO’s attention. If the Domain/NAICS code selection is deemed inappropriate, the OASIS+ Contracting Officer(s) may rescind the OCO’s OASIS+ Delegation of Procurement Authority.

Each OASIS+ CLIN under each OASIS+ contract and Domain represents a specific NAICS code. Accordingly, the fair opportunity pool for each task order includes only the contractors that were awarded an OASIS+ contract and CLIN, applicable to the task order solicitation’s contract vehicle, Domain, and NAICS code. 

#### Task Order Contract/CLIN Types

For OASIS+ task orders, allowable contract types include:
- [FAR subpart 16.2 Fixed-Price Contracts](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-16.2)
- [FAR subpart 16.3 Cost-Reimbursement Contracts](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-16.3)
- [FAR subpart 16.4 Incentive Contracts](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-16.4)
- [FAR 16.601 Time-and-Materials](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.601)
- [FAR 16.602 Labor-Hour Contracts](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.602)

Task orders may also incorporate [FAR subpart 17.1 Multiyear Contracting](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-17.1), and [FAR subpart 17.2 Options](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-17.2). However, Service Contract Labor Standards (SCLS)-applicable orders cannot have a base period longer than five years. OASIS+ supports both commercial and non-commercial requirements. OASIS+ does not allow agreements identified in [FAR subpart 16.7](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-16.7).

These contract types can be used individually or in combination within a single task order comprising multiple CLINs. If using a hybrid of contract types, please use separate CLINs for the work under each contract type and annotate each CLIN with the associated contract type, as this is important for clause selection and implementation.

For cost-reimbursement type task orders, the accounting system requirements at OASIS+ Contract Section G.3.1.9.1.1 Accounting System apply.  OASIS+ contractors were not required to demonstrate that their accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to cost-reimbursement type contracts or orders in accordance with FAR 16.301-3(a)(3). Therefore, prior to awarding a cost-reimbursement type task order, OCOs shall determine that the contractor’s accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the task order. 

Although not required, many contractors demonstrated adequate accounting systems prior to OASIS+ contract award. Contractors are required to maintain and update the status of their accounting system. The status of a contractor’s accounting system is included in their Symphony contractor profile.

Also, CAS are applicable at the task order level. Therefore, the OCO is responsible for determining the applicability of CAS to any given task order. The OCO must then ensure that the contractor has made the required solicitation certifications and that the required Disclosure Statement has been submitted. The OCO must not award a CAS covered task order until the Cognizant Federal Agency Official (CFAO) has made a written determination that a required Disclosure Statement is adequate. The contractor is required to notify the OCO for any CAS covered task orders, in writing, for any revisions to the CAS Disclosure Statement or cost accounting practices. For additional CAS specific considerations, see [Section 3.2.7 CAS Specific Clauses and Provisions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J7I14rb4RAAfU-A2yZB-ETqscM7MdBC2c2nd__NjGKA/edit#bookmark=id.se2i9zheducc). 

#### Task Order Labor Categories
In accordance with OASIS+ contract section B.8, the master contract provides the flexibility to use custom/requirements driven labor categories for CONUS, OCONUS, specialized labor, construction wage rate requirements, professional services, service contract labor standards, or any combination thereof, at the task order level. The OCO is the authority in establishing what kind of labor is appropriate for each task order requirement. 

OCOs have the following flexibilities regarding labor categories that may be used: 

1. OASIS+ standardized labor categories; or 
2. Contractor-proposed custom or specialized labor categories that are non-standard; or 
3. OCO-directed, non-standard or specialized labor categories that are customized to the requirement.

##### CONUS Standardized Labor Categories
OASIS+ CONUS standardized labor categories correspond to the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) Manual 2018, which includes compensation data maintained by the Department of Labor (DOL), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). CONUS standardized labor categories are individual labor categories that are mapped to a single SOC and functional description.

The contractor may propose CONUS standardized labor when proposing a total solution; however, the OCO will determine whether circumstances merit the use of CONUS standardized labor. CONUS standardized labor categories are encouraged but not mandatory for use at the task order level. The OCO should indicate in the task order solicitation whether or not contractors shall submit labor pricing using the master contract’s CONUS standardized labor categories in their task order proposals. If non-standardized labor categories are used at the task order level, the contractor is required to map awarded labor categories to the standardized labor categories when reporting in accordance with Section G.3.2.4 and the seniority levels in Attachment J-1 (e.g. Junior, Journeyman, Senior, Subject Matter Expert (SME)).

##### Custom or Specialized Labor

When CONUS standardized labor categories are not mandatory or not able to be mapped directly by the contractor, the contractor may propose specialized labor when proposing a total solution; however, the OCO will determine whether circumstances merit the use of specialized labor.

##### OCONUS Labor

The Contractor may propose OCONUS labor when proposing a total solution; however, the OCO will determine whether circumstances merit the use of OCONUS labor.

#### Construction Wage Rate Requirements
Any requirement whose principal purpose, as determined by the OCO, falls under the scope of FAR part 36 - Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts, is not within the scope of OASIS+.  When ancillary labor for construction, alteration and repair are included as ancillary support services within the scope of a task order for a total, integrated solution, construction wage rate requirements shall be implemented in accordance with FAR subpart 22.4 and other regulatory supplements, as applicable. The OCO shall identify such work in the task order solicitation and make a determination as to whether wage determinations are to be applied.

The master contract includes a list of clauses and/or provisions at Section I.1.2 that flow down to the task order level when construction, alteration, and repairs are within the scope of the task order. The OCO shall incorporate any additional appropriate clauses and provisions in each task order solicitation and subsequent award when construction, alteration, and repairs are within the scope of the master contract and task order requirement. When applicable, the OCO shall incorporate wage determinations subject to construction wage rate requirements in the task order award.

#### Service Contract Labor Standards

When SCLS are within the scope of the task order, wage rate requirements shall be implemented in accordance with FAR subpart 22.10 and other applicable regulatory supplements. The OCO shall identify such work in the task order solicitation and make a determination as to whether wage determinations are to be applied.

The master contract includes a list of clauses and/or provisions at Section I.1.2 that flow down to SCLS-applicable task orders. The OCO shall incorporate any additional appropriate clauses and provisions in each task order solicitation and subsequent award when service contract labor standards apply. When applicable, the OCO shall incorporate wage determinations subject to wage rate requirements in the task order award.

####  Requirements For Labor Under Time & Material and Labor Hour Task Orders

When preparing solicitations for commercial or non-commercial T&M and/or LH type task orders, the OCO shall incorporate one of the following provisions in the task order solicitation.

1. FAR 52.216-29 Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements—Non- Commercial Item Acquisition with Adequate Price Competition. 
For DoD requirements, when selecting FAR 52.216-29, the OCO shall also select Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 252.216-7002, Alternate A Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements – Non-Commercial Item Acquisition with Adequate Price Competition.
2. FAR 52.216-30 Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements—Non- Commercial Item Acquisition without Adequate Price Competition.
3. FAR 52.216-31 Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements— Commercial Item Acquisition.

When the provision FAR 52.216-30 or FAR 52.216-31 is selected, and there is an exception to fair opportunity, the OASIS+ contracts establish maximum allowable labor rates. These labor rates will be identified as fully burdened ceiling rates for certain non-custom, CONUS, T&M/LH labor categories for both government and contractor sites. Based on the specific task order requirements, the OCO is authorized to exceed the OASIS+ ceiling rates for those labor categories that include Secret/Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) labor and/or OCONUS locations, if necessary.

The ceiling rates do not apply when the provision FAR 52.216-29 Time-and-Materials/ Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements—Non-Commercial Item Acquisition With Adequate Price Competition is selected or; FAR 52.216-29 with DFARS 252.216-7002, Alternate A, is selected or; FAR 52.216-31, Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements-Commercial Item Acquisition is selected and there is not an exception to fair opportunity.

#### Travel Pricing (All Order Types)
Travel may be required to support the OASIS+ task order requirements. For those task orders requiring travel, the contractor must include estimated travel requirements in the task order proposal as required by the OCO. All travel shall be in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) [as applicable] and all lodging shall be at or below allowable, published lodging rates for the respective locality, unless an exception applies. The contractor is required to ensure good stewardship of travel funds, and shall seek rates lower than the approved FTR lodging rates whenever possible. 

For CAF considerations for travel, refer to [Section 3.2.3 Contract Access Fee](#); CAF is applied to travel. 

#### Outside the Continental United States/OCONUS 

The Department of State Standardized Regulations (DSSR) is the controlling regulations for allowances and benefits available to all U.S. Government civilians assigned to foreign areas. OCOs are authorized to select a foreign area pricing approach consistent with the DSSR tailored to their order requirements.

If a Task Order Request For Proposal (TORFP) includes foreign area work and the OCO has not identified a preferred foreign area pricing approach, contractors may include a foreign area pricing approach consistent with the DSSR in their response to a TORFP. OCOs will determine if the approach results in a fair and reasonable price in accordance with the DSSR, FAR subpart 15.4, Contract Pricing, and FAR part 16, Types of Contracts as applicable. Upon request of the OCO, the contractor must provide data other than certified cost or pricing data (FAR 15.403-3) to support its task order proposal(s).

#### Classified Task Order Considerations

The task order solicitation should clearly express all requirements for security clearances, both facility, and personnel. Please adhere to all classified handling procedures at all times.

Example for Classified work:

1. Determine Contract Vehicle/Domain/NAICS code;
2. Notify the applicable contract holders of an upcoming classified solicitation via the mandatory task order solicitation system (Symphony); requests interested contractors to respond; include instructions for how the solicitation may be viewed; i.e., location (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) or Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) email instructions);
3. Post the solicitation in secure location (i.e., distribute via SIPR emails);
4. Review the offer and award task order; and
5. Notify GSA of the task order award by emailing [OASISplus@gsa.gov](mailto:OASISplus@gsa.gov) that an award has been made (a copy of the task order is not required to be attached to the email) and include the total amount of CAF applicable to the task order.

#### Small Business Considerations
##### Small Business Size and Socioeconomic Status

In accordance with [13 CFR 121.404(a)(1)(i)(B)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/chapter-I/part-121/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR0fca5207262de47/section-121.404#p-121.404(a)(1)(i)(B)), for all OASIS+ SB, OASIS+ HUBZone, OASIS+ SDVOSB, and OASIS+ WOSB task orders, a contractor’s business size and socioeconomic status defaults to their size/status shown in their OASIS+ master contract, notwithstanding their size/status shown in any other system at the time of task order award, unless an OCO requests a size recertification for a specific order.  See below for applicability specific to OASIS+ 8(a).

##### 8(a) SB Competitive and/or Sole Source
Ordering activities seeking to satisfy their requirements through either 8(a) competitive or 8(a) sole source (direct) task orders must use the OASIS+ 8(a) contract vehicle. 

##### Competitive OASIS+ 8(a) SB Task Orders
- Competitive task orders solicited and awarded under the OASIS+ 8(a) contract shall adhere to the following:
- Follow similar procedures to competing orders (e.g., choose the Domain and NAICS code).
- Competition at any dollar value.
- Include the SBA requirement number IX1685025756D, as all OASIS+ 8(a) SB master contracts have been offered to and the requirements have been accepted by SBA for the 8(a) program. There is no requirement for SBA acceptance to receive 8(a) credit for the task order.

##### Sole Source (Direct) OASIS+ 8(a) Task Orders

Sole source task orders solicited and awarded under the OASIS+ 8(a) contract shall adhere to the following:

- Sole source (direct) OASIS+ 8(a) task orders may be issued at the OCO’s discretion subject to the OCO receiving SBA approval prior to issuing an offer from an OASIS+ 8(a) company. Sole source 8(a) orders must each be offered to and accepted by SBA before award.
- The OCO should check the contractor’s 8(a) status at [SBA Dynamic Search](https://www.sba.gov/partners/contracting-officials/small-business-procurement) before considering a sole source order. Per [13 CFR 124.503(i)(1)(iv)(A)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/part-124/section-124.503#p-124.503(i)(1)(iv)(A)), a contractor must be a current 8(a) program participant at the time of task order award in order to receive a sole source order. 
- Contractors who have exited from the 8(a) program are ineligible to receive an 8(a) sole source task order award.
- Follow the OCO agencies’ [partnership agreement](https://www.sba.gov/document/support--sba-and-agencies-partnership-agreements) for offering the sole source order to SBA.
- Are limited to $4.5 million in accordance with [FAR 19.805-1(a)(2)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.805-1);
    * Except for 8(a) concerns owned by an Indian Tribe (Tribal Owned) or an Alaska Native Corporation (ANC) (reference [FAR 19.805-1(b)(2)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.805-1)), which have a sole source order limit of $25 million in accordance with [FAR 19.808-1](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.808-1).
    * DoD only:
        - DoD may also issue sole source orders to 8(a) Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHO) (reference 13 CFR 124.506(b)(2)).
        - [DFARS 219.808-1](https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/219.808-1-sole-source.) increases sole source order limit to $100 million for ANC/Tribal Owned/NHO 8(a) concerns.
##### Sole Source (Direct) OASIS+ 8(a)Task Orders to ANC/Tribal Owned/NHO 8(a) Concerns

Sole source task orders solicited and awarded to ANC/Tribal Owned/NHO 8(a) concerns under the OASIS+ 8(a) contract shall adhere to the following:

- Notwithstanding the OASIS+ 8(a) IDIQ contract was awarded competitively, [13 CFR 124.506 (b)(1) and (2)’s](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/chapter-I/part-124/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFRd1e9fd1d2f2a3ac/section-124.506#p-124.506(b)) “...if SBA has not accepted the requirement into the 8(a) BD program as a competitive procurement…” only applies to an order level requirement and may not be used as a rationale to prohibit allowing orders to ANC/Tribal/NHO 8(a) concerns on a sole source (direct) order basis above the [FAR 19.805-1(a)(2)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.805-1) $4.5 million threshold.
- An OASIS+ 8(a) order requirement that was initially solicited on a competitive basis may not be removed from competition and subsequently awarded to an ANC/Tribal/NHO 8(a) concern on a sole source (direct) order basis. 

#### Prohibited Actions Against/Under OASIS+ Contracts

**Prohibited Action: No IDIQ or Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) may be issued against any OASIS+ contract.**

Agencies may not issue an IDIQ order instrument or Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) against the OASIS+ IDIQ contracts (see [Harris IT Services Corporation B-411699,B-411796: Oct 2, 2015](https://www.gao.gov/products/b-411699%2Cb-411796#mt%3De-report)). However, considerable flexibility with respect to variable levels of effort and requirements can be achieved through the use of optional CLINs, T&M/LH CLINs, and cost-reimbursement type CLINs (e.g., issuing a not to exceed cost-reimbursement type order with a wide scope that is incrementally funded via “Technical Direction Letters” within the scope of the task order). OCOs seeking further guidance on these flexibilities are encouraged to submit a scope review outlining the desired flexibility.

**Prohibited Action: No further set-asides may be issued under any OASIS+ contract.**

OASIS+ includes five SB contracts that were awarded as 100% small business set-asides. Further setting aside to a subset of small businesses under any OASIS+ contract is prohibited. While small businesses may hold an OASIS+ UR Contract, it is explicitly prohibited to issue any small business set-aside task order solicitations under OASIS+ UR. Additionally, for example, it is expressly prohibited to issue an Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business set-aside under OASIS+ WOSB.

**Prohibited Action: No issuance of a task order solicitation to multiple OASIS+ contracts, OASIS+ Domains or NAICS codes simultaneously.**

An OCO may NOT issue a solicitation to multiple OASIS+ contracts at the same time (e.g., issuing the same solicitation to the OASIS+ UR contract under the Management and Advisory Domain with NAICS code 541611 and the OASIS+ SB contract under the Management and Advisory Domain with NAICS code 541611 simultaneously is prohibited), nor multiple Domains at the same time (e.g., issuing the same solicitation to the Technical & Engineering Domain and Environmental Services Domain), nor multiple NAICS codes at the same time (e.g., issuing the same solicitation to NAICS code 541330 and NAICS code 541715). 

**Prohibited Action: No new awards of a task order to a contractor in dormant status ([Section 3.4.3](#)).**
