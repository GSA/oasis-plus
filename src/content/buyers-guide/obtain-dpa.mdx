A delegation of procurement authority or DPA is a written authority to issue an order under the master contract; its purpose is to clearly outline the roles and responsibilities between the GSA OASIS+ contracting officer and the ordering contracting officer.

## When is a DPA required?

### You need a DPA:

<IconList>
  <CheckListItem icon="check_circle" color="text-green">
    if you are a contracting officer (COs) who plans to award, administer, and
    modify task orders against the OASIS+ contracts.
  </CheckListItem>
</IconList>

Agency COs that do not have DPAs may not award task orders under OASIS+.

DPA training is encouraged for any staff (Program Manager, Contract Specialist, Finance, Interns, etc.) interested in and/or administering an OASIS+ requirement; however, only a warranted Contracting Officer may obtain the Delegation of Procurement Authority.

### You do not need a DPA:

<IconList>
  <CheckListItem icon="cancel" color="text-red">
    to conduct market research into the OASIS+ program or to use the task order
    solicitation system (Symphony) to conduct market research.
  </CheckListItem>
  <CheckListItem icon="cancel" color="text-red">
    if you are an OASIS+ Contract Section G.2.2.1 Ordering Contracting Officer,
    Contractor employees*.
  </CheckListItem>
</IconList>

*In accordance with OASIS+ Contract Section G.2.2.1 Ordering Contracting Officer, Contractor employees are authorized under [FAR subpart 51.1 Contractor Use of Government Supply Sources](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-51.1) to use OASIS+ and are considered OCOs and are not required to obtain a DPA as their authority is granted to them by a Federal Government CO administering an applicable contract (e.g., a Federally Funded Research and Development Center or [FFRDC](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/)). In order to authorize a Contractor employee under FAR subpart 51.1 to use OASIS+, the Federal Government CO granting authority shall first obtain an OASIS+ DPA.
## How do you get a DPA?
To obtain an OASIS+ DPA, a warranted CO (appointed according to FAR 1.603) or an official authorized to obligate funds for the agency must:

<ProcessList>
    <ProcessListItem>
        **Be a warranted Contracting Officer as defined in [FAR 2.101](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/2.101) Definitions.**
    </ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListItem>
        **Attend a DPA training.**

        Training is currently under development. It will be available online, virtually, and in-person; visit this page and [OASIS+ Interact Community](https://buy.gsa.gov/interact/community/196/activity-feed) for updates.
    </ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListItem>
        **Review the corresponding Delegation of Procurement Authority Ordering Guide for OASIS+.**
    </ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListItem>
        **Submit documentation.**

        Provide the CO warrant number and DPA training completion certificate to OASIS+ DPA training at [oasisplusDPA@gsa.gov](mailto:oasisplusDPA@gsa.gov).
    </ProcessListItem>
     <ProcessListItem>
        **Request a DPA.**
        
        Complete and submit the [DPA Request Form](#).

        GSA will review your request, and you will receive a confirmation of the DPA via email within two business days. If you get a warrant after receiving training, you can request a DPA by emailing the respective program training at either [oasisplusDPA@gsa.gov](mailto:oasisplusDPA@gsa.gov) or [HCaTSTraining@gsa.gov](mailto:HCaTSTraining@gsa.gov).

        Note: DPA requestors must provide a .gov or .mil email address. If you do not have a .gov or .mil work email address, please contact the OASIS+ Contracting Officer at [oasisplus@gsa.gov](mailto:oasisplus@gsa.gov) for assistance in requesting a DPA.

    </ProcessListItem>
</ProcessList>

## You have a DPA, now what?
Once a CO receives a DPA, the individual is officially identified as an OCO. An OCO has the authority to award, administer, and modify task orders against the OASIS+ contracts. CO’s that do not have DPAs may not award task orders under OASIS+.

DPAs are issued to individuals; not to agencies. DPAs may be revoked at the discretion of the OASIS+ Contracting Officer(s). There is no limit on DPA’s issued per agency, and individuals may repeat DPA training as often as they prefer. GSA cannot release the names of individuals with a DPA, even if requested by the agency; this information is Controlled Unclassified Information.
