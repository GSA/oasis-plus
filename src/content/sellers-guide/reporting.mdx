The OASIS+ contract requires vendors to properly report sales in the FAS [Sales Reporting Portal (SRP)](https://srp.fas.gsa.gov/). SRP is the system used by FAS for Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) sales reporting, and echos the functionality vendors may be used to from other contracts in the Contract Payment and Reporting Module (CPRM) of ASSIST. Vendors must use SRP to:

- Report new task orders awarded against their contract within 30 days after award.
- Report invoices for each task order monthly, reporting “zero sales” if no invoices were issued.
- Remit Contract Access Fees (CAF) collected from customers on a quarterly basis (no later than 30 days after the last date of the quarter). OASIS+ has a set CAF rate for all customers at 0.15% against all costs, including ODCs, on each invoice.
