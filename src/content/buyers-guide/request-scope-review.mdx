GSA strongly encourages Ordering Contracting Officers to take advantage of the free, complementary, optional pre-solicitation scope reviews. A scope review is an analysis of a Statement of Work (SOW), Statement of Objectives (SOO), or Performance Work Statement (PWS) for future services tasks, along with a scope compatibility determination to help you establish whether your requirement is within the scope of the GSA contract being considered. This review will ensure the requirement is being placed under the appropriate contract vehicle; this will help you meet requirements correctly and move through the process as efficiently as possible.

## How to request a scope review

To request a scope review you must:
1. Complete the OASIS+ Scope Review Online form (coming soon). In addition to the free and complementary scope review, we can provide Market Research as a Service (MRaS) [complete-market-research/#]mras upon request.
2. Use the applicable OASIS+ master contract Section C.2 and subsections to choose the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code representing the principle purpose of your requirement. For specific NAICS code definitions, please visit https://www.census.gov/naics/
3. Input that NAICS code and corresponding pool in the Primary NAICS field of the form. For example, for military engineering: “NAICS 541330 Exception A (Pool 3)”.
4. Complete your SOW/SOO/PWS.
5. Complete your Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) using your Agency’s government estimate with labor categories and hours template or generated using the [CALC+ suite of pricing eTools](https://buy.gsa.gov/pricing/).

We cannot complete the scope review until the completed scope review form, SOW/SOO/PWS, and IGCE have been received. If you do not hear back within five business days of submitting all documents, email [oasisplus@gsa.gov](mailto:oasisplus@gsa.gov) for an update.
