The following information is related to researching contract features — specifically, those that focus on small business.

## Small business size and socioeconomic status

In accordance with [13 CFR 121.404(a)(1)(i)(B)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/chapter-I/part-121/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR0fca5207262de47/section-121.404#p-121.404(a)(1)(i)(B)), for all OASIS+ SB, OASIS+ HUBZone, OASIS+ SDVOSB, and OASIS+ WOSB task orders, a contractor's business size and socioeconomic status defaults to their size/status shown in their OASIS+ master contract, notwithstanding their size/status shown in any other system at the time of task order award, unless an OCO requests a size recertification for a specific order.  See below for applicability specific to OASIS+ 8(a). 

## OASIS+ 8(a) SB competitive and/or sole source

Ordering activities seeking to satisfy their requirements through either 8(a) competitive or 8(a) sole source (direct) task orders must use the OASIS+ 8(a) contract vehicle. 

## Competitive OASIS+ 8(a) SB task orders

Competitive task orders solicited and awarded under the OASIS+ 8(a) contract must:

- Follow similar procedures to competing orders (e.g., choose the domain and NAICS code).
- Allow competition at any dollar value.
- Include the SBA requirement number IX1685025756D, as all OASIS+ 8(a) SB master contracts have been offered to and the requirements have been accepted by SBA for the 8(a) program. There is no requirement for SBA acceptance to receive 8(a) credit for the task order.

## Sole source (direct) OASIS+ 8(a) task orders

Sole source task orders solicited and awarded under the OASIS+ 8(a) contract shall adhere to the following:

- Sole source (direct) OASIS+ 8(a) task orders may be issued at the OCO’s discretion subject to the OCO receiving SBA approval prior to issuing an offer from an OASIS+ 8(a) company. Sole source 8(a) orders must each be offered to and accepted by SBA before award.
- The OCO should check the contractor’s 8(a) status at [SBA Dynamic Search](https://www.sba.gov/partners/contracting-officials/small-business-procurement) before considering a sole source order. Per [13 CFR 124.503(i)(1)(iv)(A)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/part-124/section-124.503#p-124.503(i)(1)(iv)(A)), a contractor must be a current 8(a) program participant at the time of task order award in order to receive a sole source order. 
- Contractors who have exited from the 8(a) program are ineligible to receive an 8(a) sole source task order award.
- Follow the OCO agencies’[ partnership agreement](https://www.sba.gov/document/support--sba-and-agencies-partnership-agreements) for offering the sole source order to SBA.
- Are limited to $4.5 million in accordance with [FAR 19.805-1(a)(2)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.805-1);
    - Except for 8(a) concerns owned by an Indian Tribe (Tribal Owned) or an Alaska Native Corporation (ANC) (reference [FAR 19.805-1(b)(2)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.805-1)), which have a sole source order limit of $25 million in accordance with FAR [19.808-1](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.808-1).
    - DoD only:
        - DoD may also issue sole source orders to 8(a) Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHO) (reference [13 CFR 124.506(b)(2))](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/chapter-I/part-124/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFRd1e9fd1d2f2a3ac/section-124.506#p-124.506(b)).
        - [DFARS 219.808-1](https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/219.808-1-sole-source.) increases sole source order limit to $100 million for ANC/Tribal Owned/NHO 8(a) concerns.


## Sole source (direct) OASIS+ 8(a) task orders to ANC/Tribal owned/NHO 8(a) concerns

Sole source task orders solicited and awarded to ANC/Tribal owned/NHO 8(a) concerns under the OASIS+ 8(a) contract shall adhere to the following:

- Notwithstanding the OASIS+ 8(a) IDIQ contract was awarded competitively, [13 CFR 124.506 (b)(1) and (2)’s](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/chapter-I/part-124/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFRd1e9fd1d2f2a3ac/section-124.506#p-124.506(b)) “…if SBA has not accepted the requirement into the 8(a) BD program as a competitive procurement…” only applies to an order level requirement and may not be used as a rationale to prohibit allowing orders to ANC/Tribal/NHO 8(a) concerns on a sole source (direct) order basis above the[ FAR 19.805-1(a)(2)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.805-1) $4.5 million threshold.
- An OASIS+ 8(a) order requirement that was initially solicited on a competitive basis may not be removed from competition and subsequently awarded to an ANC/Tribal/NHO 8(a) concern on a sole source (direct) order basis.
