A delegation of procurement authority (DPA) is a written authority to issue an order under the master contract; it clearly outlines the roles and responsibilities between the GSA OASIS+ contracting officer and the ordering contracting officer. The first requirement to solicit, evaluate, and award task orders under OASIS+ is that the Contracting Officer (CO) must obtain a DPA to become a “delegated” OCO.


## When is a DPA required?

### You need a DPA:

    If you are a contracting officer (CO) who plans to solicit, evaluate, award, and
    modify task orders against the OASIS+ contracts.

</IconList>

Obtaining a DPA is the first requirement a CO must meet to solicit, evaluate, award, and modify task orders under OASIS+. A CO must obtain a DPA from an OASIS+ CO to become a “delegated” OCO. The task order OCO is the sole and exclusive government official with authority to solicit, evaluate, award, administer, and/or modify a task order under the master contract.

A DPA is **not** required to conduct market research into the OASIS+ program or to use eBuy to conduct market research, which includes issuing RFIs. DPA training is encouraged for any staff (Program Manager, Contract Specialist, Finance, Interns, etc.) interested in and/or administering an OASIS+ requirement. The training is required for any staff to post a solicitation in eBuy; however, only a warranted Contracting Officer may obtain the DPA. The dates of upcoming DPA training sessions are available on the [OASIS+ website](https://www.gsa.gov/oasis-plus/events-training/)   
**NOTE: Contract Specialists and other acquisition personnel are highly encouraged to take the DPA training course.** 

To obtain an OASIS+ DPA, a CO must:
1. Be a warranted Contracting Officer as defined in [FAR 2.101](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/2.101) Definitions; and
2. Attend OASIS+ DPA training; and 
3. Formally apply for the DPA via the [OASIS+ Website](https://www.gsa.gov/oasis-plus/buyers-guide/obtain-dpa/)

### You do not need a DPA:

*In accordance with OASIS+ Contract Section G.2.2.1 Ordering Contracting Officer, Contractor employees are authorized under [FAR subpart 51.1 Contractor Use of Government Supply Sources](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-51.1) to use OASIS+ and are considered OCOs and are not required to obtain a DPA as their authority is granted to them by a Federal Government CO administering an applicable contract (e.g., a Federally Funded Research and Development Center or [FFRDC](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/)). In order to authorize a Contractor employee under FAR subpart 51.1 to use OASIS+, the Federal Government CO granting authority shall first obtain an OASIS+ DPA.
## How do you get a DPA?
To obtain an OASIS+ DPA, a warranted CO (appointed according to FAR 1.603) or an official authorized to obligate funds for the agency must:

        GSA will review your request, and you will receive a confirmation of the DPA via email within two business days. If you get a warrant after receiving training, you can request a DPA by emailing [oasisplusDPA@gsa.gov](mailto:oasisplusDPA@gsa.gov).
        

        Note: DPA requestors must provide a .gov or .mil email address. If you do not have a .gov or .mil work email address, please contact the OASIS+ Contracting Officer at [oasisplusDPA@gsa.gov](mailto:oasisplusDPA@gsa.gov) for assistance in requesting a DPA.

## You have a DPA, now what?
Once a CO receives a DPA, the individual is officially identified as an OCO. An OCO has the authority to award, administer, and modify task orders against the OASIS+ contracts. COs that do not have DPAs may not award task orders under OASIS+.

DPAs are issued to individuals; not to agencies. DPAs may be revoked at the discretion of the OASIS+ Contracting Officer(s). There is no limit on DPAs issued per agency, and individuals may repeat DPA training as often as they prefer. 

### Support developing solicitations
