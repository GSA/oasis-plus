## Introduction
Thank you for choosing the OASIS+ family of contracts to fulfill your complex, integrated multiple service needs! This suite of services contracts is available for use by agencies throughout the Federal Government, as defined in Section 2.1, who hold a Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA), as referenced in Section 3.0.

The OASIS+ contracts provide a common architecture and platform across the Federal Government for the acquisition of a full range of service requirements that integrate multiple service disciplines and ancillary services/products with the flexibility for commercial and non-commercial requirements, all contract types and pricing determined at the task order level to achieve a total solution. 

This Ordering Guide explains how the OASIS+ contracts can be used to satisfy a wide variety of services requirements. It does not address general contracting issues or concepts unless necessary for complete understanding. Online resources supporting the use of OASIS+ are available on the General Service Administration's (GSA's) [OASIS+ website](https://www.gsa.gov/oasis-plus/) and GSA's [OASIS+ Interact site](https://buy.gsa.gov/interact/community/196/activity-feed). This guide is to demonstrate just how easy OASIS+ makes the ordering process!

## Program overview
### Contract Families

OASIS+ has six separate “families” of Multi-Agency Contracts (MAC), collectively referred to as OASIS+, these include:


- Unrestricted (UR)
- Total Small Business (SB)
- SBA-Certified 8(a) Small Business (8a)
- SBA-Certified HUBZone Small Business (HZ)
- SBA-Certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)
- SBA-Certified Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB)

The OASIS+ UR contracts were awarded as full and open competition. The OASIS+ SB contracts were awarded as 100% small business set-asides. The OASIS+ 8(a) program was awarded as a 100% set aside for exclusive competition among 8(a) participants, which was offered to and accepted by Small Business Administration (SBA) under SBA requirement number **IX1685025756D**.

### Ordering Period
OASIS+ is a collection of multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, of which the contract base period is five (5) years with one (1) option period of five (5) years that may extend the cumulative contract ordering period to 10 years. Task orders can be awarded under OASIS+ any time prior to the expiration of the ordering period of the master contracts. Notwithstanding, the OASIS+ IDIQ master contracts (contractor specific) can have different award dates; however, all contracts for each specific contract family have the same contract end dates (e.g., all of the Small Business contracts will end on the same date).

### Which Agencies Can Use OASIS+?

OASIS+ contracts may be used by all federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD) and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), but are not open to state and local governments at this time. See [4800.2I OGP Eligibility to Use GSA Sources of Supply and Services](https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/OGP%20Order%2048002I%20Eligibility%20Determination.pdf) for details. 

### Interagency Acquisition Applicability
Orders issued against the OASIS+ contracts are considered Interagency Acquisitions. GSA has specific statutory authority under [40 U.S.C. 501](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title%3A40%20section%3A501%20edition%3Aprelim)%20OR%20(granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title40-section501)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) to purchase supplies and non-personal services on behalf of other agencies. Therefore, the [Economy Act](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/17.502-2) does not apply to OASIS+ orders.

### Contracts Scope
The contract scope of OASIS+ is organized by Domains. The term Domain refers to a functional grouping of related services spanning multiple NAICS codes. Domains and the NAICS codes listed under the Domains are designed to align order requirements to qualified industry partners. Each Domain is limited to the NAICS codes and associated size standards specifically listed under that Domain. 

The OASIS+ contracts cover services that are: primarily noncommercial, with the allowance for commercial services task orders classified and unclassified; and within the Continental US (CONUS) and Outside the Continental US (OCONUS). All OASIS+ task orders must be within scope of the respective OASIS+ IDIQ contract for which it is awarded, provided the Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) determines the principal purpose NAICS code for the order to be one of the OASIS+ NAICS codes ([Appendix A](#appendix-a-performance-areas---domains)). If the OCO determines its requirement has a NAICS code outside one of the OASIS+ NAICS codes, the requirement is not within scope of OASIS+.
#### Scope for Information Technology & Non-Information Technology

Information Technology (IT), by definition, means any equipment, or interconnected system(s) or subsystem(s) of equipment that is used for the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the agency. For purposes of this definition, if the equipment is used by the agency directly or is used by a contractor under a contract with the agency that requires its use, or to a significant extent, its use in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.

IT is considered an ancillary support service or product on the Domains, and may be performed only when the service or product is integral and necessary to complete a total integrated solution. “Non-IT” includes any service or equipment that is acquired by a Contractor incidental to a contract or contains embedded IT that is used as an integral part of the service or product, but the principal function of which is not the acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. (For example, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment, such as thermostats or temperature control devices, and medical equipment where IT is integral to its operation, is non-IT).

Non-IT also includes any equipment or services related to a National Security System in accordance with [40 USC § 11103 (a)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:40%20section:11103%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title40-section11103)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true). The term “National Security System” means a telecommunications or information system operated by the Federal Government, the function, operation, or use of which involves intelligence activities, cryptologic activities related to national security, command and control of military forces, equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or, is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions, not including a system to be used for routine administrative and business applications (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications).

Non-IT may include embedded IT components including software, IT hardware, and other items and services traditionally considered IT on IT requirements.

Non-IT professional services are not considered ancillary support services. Non-IT professional services are considered to be within the primary scope of the Domains.

#### Task Orders - Scope/Services Not Allowed
OASIS+ task orders shall NOT include any of the following:
- Any requirement for Inherently Governmental Functions as defined in FAR 2.101.
- Any requirement for Personal Services as defined in FAR 2.101.
- Any requirement whose principal purpose - as determined by the OCO - falls under the scope of [FAR part 36 - Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-36). (Note: This does not preclude use of Architects and Engineers for services not required to be under FAR part 36 such as Construction Management, etc..)
- Any requirement whose principal purpose - as determined by the OCO - is in a NAICS code not listed under the corresponding Domain solicited. 

### Domains
The OASIS+ Domains available to provide a total solution to agency needs are:

<div class="oasis-2-column-image-list">
- ![Icons of people under an ascending arrow](/images/domain-icons/management.svg) Management and Advisory
- ![Microscope](/images/domain-icons/research.svg) Research and Development
- ![Half an earth with a seedling growing out of it](/images/domain-icons/sustainability.svg) Environmental
- ![Two hands holding up a cube](/images/domain-icons/logistics.svg) Logistics 
- ![Three gears](/images/domain-icons/tech.svg) Technical and Engineering

- ![A building with a group of people in front](/images/domain-icons/enterprise.svg) *Enterprise Solutions *(Only available on the OASIS+ UR IDIQ)
</div>

### Pricing

OASIS+ pricing is not allowed to be released to the public; however, the pricing will be available to OCO’s who hold a DPA. Pricing (ceiling rates) will be located within the task order solicitation system, which is the [Symphony Procurement Suite](https://oasis.app.cloud.gov/) (Symphony), and is not for public sharing or release. Symphony is referred to as the OASIS+ Submission Portal (OSP) in the OASIS+ RFPs and master contracts. The non-published OASIS+ ceiling rates apply only to sole source Time and Material (T&M)/Labor Hour (LH) orders and no other order type. OASIS+ pricing reflects ceiling rates based upon the highest qualified employees within a given labor category, working in the highest paid area within CONUS, on a highly complex requirement, excluding Secret/Top Secret/Secret Compartmented Information and OCONUS work. It is recommended that this pricing only be used in conjunction with other proposal analysis techniques at FAR 15.404-1 to ensure that the final agreed-to-price is fair and reasonable.

Pricing is determined fair and reasonable based on competition at the order level, and negotiation of pricing is highly encouraged at the task order level. 

GSA offers a [Pricing Intelligence Suite](https://buy.gsa.gov/pricing/) with multiple pricing resources including the Contract Awarded Labor Category Plus (CALC+) Tools.

### Roles and Responsibilities
#### GSA Responsibilities
GSA is responsible for award, administration, and management of the OASIS+ IDIQ contracts. Among the responsibilities GSA will meet are:

- Monitoring and evaluation of the performance against the IDIQ contract requirements by each contract holder;
- Holding exclusive, non-delegable rights to modify master contract Terms and Conditions;
- Providing advice and guidance to Ordering/requiring activities, OCOs and contractors regarding all OASIS+ contract terms and conditions, and other procurement-related matters; and
- Conducting Program Management Reviews (PMRs) and meetings with OASIS+ prime contractors as scheduled and/or necessary.

#### Requiring Activity Responsibilities
For OASIS+ task orders, the Requiring Activity is responsible for: 
- Defining the task order requirements;
- Preparing the Statement of Work (SOW)/Performance Work Statement (PWS)/Statement of Objectives (SOO) for task order Request for Proposals (RFPs);
- Funding the requirements;
- Assisting the OCO with quote/proposal evaluation;
- Assisting the OCO with performance monitoring and appraisal;
- Ensuring regulatory and performance compliance at the task order level; and

- Determining a contractor’s accounting system is adequate before making an award of a cost-reimbursement task order.
- Determining the applicability of Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) to any given task order and ensuring the contractor has made the required CAS-related task order solicitation certifications.
- Determining pricing is fair and reasonable at the task order level; 
- Administering task orders issued under OASIS+ from cradle to grave:
    * Administration of task order award data in Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) upon task order award, if applicable.
    * Inclusion and administration of the Contract Access Fee (CAF) CLIN for the base and each option period of the task order and sufficiently funding the CAF for the life of the task order.
    * Monitoring limitations on subcontracting for each task order in accordance with [13 CFR 125.6(d)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/part-125#p-125.6(d)) “... for a multi-agency set aside contract where more than one agency can issue orders under the contract, the ordering agency must use the period of performance for each order to determine compliance.”
    * Administration of task order performance evaluation in Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), if applicable.
    * Resolving any performance issues, disputes, claims, or protests at the task order level.
    * Closing out task orders in a timely manner.

- Responding to all Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Congressional, Inspector General, Small Business Administration, and/or the Government Accountability Office (GAO) requests for task order information.

### Benefits and Considerations

OASIS+ is flexible, easy to use, and allows ordering activities to solicit and/or award orders in a streamlined, high quality manner.
The benefits of OASIS+ include:
- Task orders that may be: 
    * Awarded against six contract families that have no contract ceiling or cap on awards;
    * For work performed in CONUS and/or OCONUS locations;
    * For complex commercial or non-commercial services;
    * For any contract type, including hybrid mix and structures of Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) types tailored to individual task order requirements;
- Open on-ramping; after the initial phase of awards, the solicitation for OASIS+ will remain continuously open, allowing potential industry partners to obtain OASIS+ contracts at any time as long as they qualify;
- Flexible/expandable Domain-based structure; ability to add Domains based on government need;
- A cumulative ordering period of 10 years;
- Technology-based ordering and market research tools;
- Access to an industrial base of highly qualified contractors;
- Ancillary services and Other Direct Costs (ODCs) defined as integral and necessary to complete a total integrated solution under a requirement are within the scope of the master contract;
- Access transactional data and data analytics for spend analysis and market research;
- Save time without having to complete the following, which have already been completed at the OASIS+ master contract level;
    * [FAR subpart 9.1](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-9.1) responsibility determinations;
    * [FAR 22.805](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/22.805) pre-award clearances (“Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Clearances”);
    * General Services Administration Manual/ Regulation [(GSAM/R) 505.303-70](https://www.acquisition.gov/gsam/505.303-70) congressional notifications; however, the ordering agency specific policies will still be applicable/required.
## Task Order issuance overview
### Step 1 - Delegation of Procurement Authority
The first requirement to solicit, evaluate, and award task orders under OASIS+ is that the Contracting Officer (CO) must obtain a DPA to become a “delegated” OCO. Only if a DPA is granted to an OCO from an OASIS+ CO may an OCO solicit and award a task order under the master contract(s). The task order OCO is the sole and exclusive government official with authority to solicit, evaluate, award, administer, and/or modify a task order under the master contract.

A DPA is not required to conduct market research into the OASIS+ program or to use Symphony to conduct market research, which includes issuing RFIs. DPA training is encouraged for any staff (Program Manager, Contract Specialist, Finance, Interns, etc.) interested in and/or administering an OASIS+ requirement. The training is required for any staff to post a solicitation in Symphony; however, only a warranted Contracting Officer may obtain the DPA. The dates of available DPA training sessions are (anticipated to be live on the [OASIS+ website](https://www.gsa.gov/oasis-plus/), coming soon, prior to commencement of the ordering period).  

NOTE: Contract Specialists and other acquisition personnel are highly encouraged to take the DPA training course. 

To obtain an OASIS+ DPA, a CO must:

1. Be a warranted Contracting Officer as defined in FAR 2.101 Definitions; and
2. Attend OASIS+ DPA training; and 
3. Formally apply for the DPA; How to apply for a DPA TBD (anticipated to be live on the OASIS+ website, coming soon, prior to commencement of the ordering period). 

DPAs are issued to individuals; not to agencies. DPAs may be revoked at the discretion of the OASIS+ Contracting Officer(s). There is no limit on DPAs issued per agency, and individuals may repeat DPA training as often as preferred. 

#### Exception to DPA Requirement

In accordance with OASIS+ Contract Section G.2.2.1 Ordering Contracting Officer, contractor employees are authorized under [FAR subpart 51.1 Contractor Use of Government Supply Sources](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-51.1) to use OASIS+ and are considered OCOs and are not required to obtain a DPA as their authority is granted to them by a Federal Government CO administering an applicable contract (e.g., a Federally Funded Research and Development Center ([FFRDC](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/))). In order to authorize a contractor employee under FAR subpart 51.1 to use OASIS+, the Federal Government CO granting authority shall first obtain an OASIS+ DPA.

### Step 2 - Acquisition Planning Considerations
The OCO must complete acquisition planning and market research to determine whether OASIS+ meets their needs, as such the OCO must:

- Determine whether the specific requirement is within scope of OASIS+. 
- Determine if an OASIS+ Small Business or Socioeconomic Small Business can perform the requirements and set-aside for small business concerns, if applicable. 
- Determine which OASIS+ contract to issue the task order solicitation under. 

Task orders planned under OASIS+ are not exempt from [FAR Part 7 - Acquisition Planning](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-7) or [FAR Part 10 - Market Research](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-10). Agencies may have different policies, regulations, standards, etc, that should be considered in the decision to use OASIS+ to fulfill an agency requirement.

OASIS+ offers several approaches to aid the market research, such as:

- Research (or send an RFI to) OASIS+ contract holders and their capabilities within each OASIS+ contract, Domain, and NAICS code using [Symphony](https://oasis.app.cloud.gov/);
- Research (Optional scope review) for OASIS+ contract holders may be requested via [OASIS+ Scope Review](https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_6s3udkBbX9z1zee). The scope review is completed by GSA and will ensure the requirement is being placed under the appropriate OASIS+ contract. 
- Research (or send an RFI) using Market Research as a Service (MRAS), a free service offering a streamlined innovative approach to conducting RFI’s quickly and efficiently, after completing an optional [OASIS+ Scope Review](https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_6s3udkBbX9z1zee) (anticipated to be live on the [OASIS+ website](https://www.gsa.gov/oasis-plus/), coming soon, prior to commencement of the ordering period). Contact the [local GSA Customer Service Director](http://gsa.gov/csd) for assistance with MRAS. 

#### Domain and NAICS Selection

**Only one Domain and one NAICS code under one contract family must be selected.**

OASIS+ Domains each contain multiple NAICS codes. [FAR 19.102](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.102) requires the OCO to determine the appropriate NAICS code and assign one NAICS code and corresponding small business size standard in all solicitations and task orders. [FAR 19.102(b)(1)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.102) requires that the NAICS code assigned describes the principal purpose of the service being acquired. The tables in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-performance-areas---domains) identify the OASIS+ Domains and NAICS codes with their corresponding size standards. 

Note: In accordance with regulation, OCOs must select the task order NAICS code based upon the work to be performed and not based upon the applicable size standard or program office supported. Apparent discrepancies will be brought to the OCO’s attention. If the Domain/NAICS code selection is deemed inappropriate, the OASIS+ Contracting Officer(s) may rescind the OCO’s OASIS+ Delegation of Procurement Authority.

Each OASIS+ CLIN under each OASIS+ contract and Domain represents a specific NAICS code. Accordingly, the fair opportunity pool for each task order includes only the contractors that were awarded an OASIS+ contract and CLIN, applicable to the task order solicitation’s contract vehicle, Domain, and NAICS code. 

#### Task Order Contract/CLIN Types

For OASIS+ task orders, allowable contract types include:
- [FAR subpart 16.2 Fixed-Price Contracts](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-16.2)
- [FAR subpart 16.3 Cost-Reimbursement Contracts](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-16.3)
- [FAR subpart 16.4 Incentive Contracts](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-16.4)
- [FAR 16.601 Time-and-Materials](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.601)
- [FAR 16.602 Labor-Hour Contracts](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.602)

Task orders may also incorporate [FAR subpart 17.1 Multiyear Contracting](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-17.1), and [FAR subpart 17.2 Options](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-17.2). However, Service Contract Labor Standards (SCLS)-applicable orders cannot have a base period longer than five years. OASIS+ supports both commercial and non-commercial requirements. OASIS+ does not allow agreements identified in [FAR subpart 16.7](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-16.7).

These contract types can be used individually or in combination within a single task order comprising multiple CLINs. If using a hybrid of contract types, please use separate CLINs for the work under each contract type and annotate each CLIN with the associated contract type, as this is important for clause selection and implementation.

For cost-reimbursement type task orders, the accounting system requirements at OASIS+ Contract Section G.3.1.9.1.1 Accounting System apply.  OASIS+ contractors were not required to demonstrate that their accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to cost-reimbursement type contracts or orders in accordance with FAR 16.301-3(a)(3). Therefore, prior to awarding a cost-reimbursement type task order, OCOs shall determine that the contractor’s accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the task order. 

Although not required, many contractors demonstrated adequate accounting systems prior to OASIS+ contract award. Contractors are required to maintain and update the status of their accounting system. The status of a contractor’s accounting system is included in their Symphony contractor profile.

Also, CAS are applicable at the task order level. Therefore, the OCO is responsible for determining the applicability of CAS to any given task order. The OCO must then ensure that the contractor has made the required solicitation certifications and that the required Disclosure Statement has been submitted. The OCO must not award a CAS covered task order until the Cognizant Federal Agency Official (CFAO) has made a written determination that a required Disclosure Statement is adequate. The contractor is required to notify the OCO for any CAS covered task orders, in writing, for any revisions to the CAS Disclosure Statement or cost accounting practices. For additional CAS specific considerations, see [Section 3.2.7 CAS Specific Clauses and Provisions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J7I14rb4RAAfU-A2yZB-ETqscM7MdBC2c2nd__NjGKA/edit#bookmark=id.se2i9zheducc). 

#### Task Order Labor Categories
In accordance with OASIS+ contract section B.8, the master contract provides the flexibility to use custom/requirements driven labor categories for CONUS, OCONUS, specialized labor, construction wage rate requirements, professional services, service contract labor standards, or any combination thereof, at the task order level. The OCO is the authority in establishing what kind of labor is appropriate for each task order requirement. 

OCOs have the following flexibilities regarding labor categories that may be used: 

1. OASIS+ standardized labor categories; or 
2. Contractor-proposed custom or specialized labor categories that are non-standard; or 
3. OCO-directed, non-standard or specialized labor categories that are customized to the requirement.

##### CONUS Standardized Labor Categories
OASIS+ CONUS standardized labor categories correspond to the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) Manual 2018, which includes compensation data maintained by the Department of Labor (DOL), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). CONUS standardized labor categories are individual labor categories that are mapped to a single SOC and functional description.

The contractor may propose CONUS standardized labor when proposing a total solution; however, the OCO will determine whether circumstances merit the use of CONUS standardized labor. CONUS standardized labor categories are encouraged but not mandatory for use at the task order level. The OCO should indicate in the task order solicitation whether or not contractors shall submit labor pricing using the master contract’s CONUS standardized labor categories in their task order proposals. If non-standardized labor categories are used at the task order level, the contractor is required to map awarded labor categories to the standardized labor categories when reporting in accordance with Section G.3.2.4 and the seniority levels in Attachment J-1 (e.g. Junior, Journeyman, Senior, Subject Matter Expert (SME)).

##### Custom or Specialized Labor

When CONUS standardized labor categories are not mandatory or not able to be mapped directly by the contractor, the contractor may propose specialized labor when proposing a total solution; however, the OCO will determine whether circumstances merit the use of specialized labor.

##### OCONUS Labor

The Contractor may propose OCONUS labor when proposing a total solution; however, the OCO will determine whether circumstances merit the use of OCONUS labor.

#### Construction Wage Rate Requirements
Any requirement whose principal purpose, as determined by the OCO, falls under the scope of FAR part 36 - Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts, is not within the scope of OASIS+.  When ancillary labor for construction, alteration and repair are included as ancillary support services within the scope of a task order for a total, integrated solution, construction wage rate requirements shall be implemented in accordance with FAR subpart 22.4 and other regulatory supplements, as applicable. The OCO shall identify such work in the task order solicitation and make a determination as to whether wage determinations are to be applied.

The master contract includes a list of clauses and/or provisions at Section I.1.2 that flow down to the task order level when construction, alteration, and repairs are within the scope of the task order. The OCO shall incorporate any additional appropriate clauses and provisions in each task order solicitation and subsequent award when construction, alteration, and repairs are within the scope of the master contract and task order requirement. When applicable, the OCO shall incorporate wage determinations subject to construction wage rate requirements in the task order award.

#### Service Contract Labor Standards

When SCLS are within the scope of the task order, wage rate requirements shall be implemented in accordance with FAR subpart 22.10 and other applicable regulatory supplements. The OCO shall identify such work in the task order solicitation and make a determination as to whether wage determinations are to be applied.

The master contract includes a list of clauses and/or provisions at Section I.1.2 that flow down to SCLS-applicable task orders. The OCO shall incorporate any additional appropriate clauses and provisions in each task order solicitation and subsequent award when service contract labor standards apply. When applicable, the OCO shall incorporate wage determinations subject to wage rate requirements in the task order award.

####  Requirements For Labor Under Time & Material and Labor Hour Task Orders

When preparing solicitations for commercial or non-commercial T&M and/or LH type task orders, the OCO shall incorporate one of the following provisions in the task order solicitation.

1. FAR 52.216-29 Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements—Non- Commercial Item Acquisition with Adequate Price Competition. 
For DoD requirements, when selecting FAR 52.216-29, the OCO shall also select Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 252.216-7002, Alternate A Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements – Non-Commercial Item Acquisition with Adequate Price Competition.
2. FAR 52.216-30 Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements—Non- Commercial Item Acquisition without Adequate Price Competition.
3. FAR 52.216-31 Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements— Commercial Item Acquisition.

When the provision FAR 52.216-30 or FAR 52.216-31 is selected, and there is an exception to fair opportunity, the OASIS+ contracts establish maximum allowable labor rates. These labor rates will be identified as fully burdened ceiling rates for certain non-custom, CONUS, T&M/LH labor categories for both government and contractor sites. Based on the specific task order requirements, the OCO is authorized to exceed the OASIS+ ceiling rates for those labor categories that include Secret/Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) labor and/or OCONUS locations, if necessary.

The ceiling rates do not apply when the provision FAR 52.216-29 Time-and-Materials/ Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements—Non-Commercial Item Acquisition With Adequate Price Competition is selected or; FAR 52.216-29 with DFARS 252.216-7002, Alternate A, is selected or; FAR 52.216-31, Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements-Commercial Item Acquisition is selected and there is not an exception to fair opportunity.

#### Travel Pricing (All Order Types)
Travel may be required to support the OASIS+ task order requirements. For those task orders requiring travel, the contractor must include estimated travel requirements in the task order proposal as required by the OCO. All travel shall be in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) [as applicable] and all lodging shall be at or below allowable, published lodging rates for the respective locality, unless an exception applies. The contractor is required to ensure good stewardship of travel funds, and shall seek rates lower than the approved FTR lodging rates whenever possible. 

For CAF considerations for travel, refer to [Section 3.2.3 Contract Access Fee](#contract-access-fee); CAF is applied to travel. 

#### Outside the Continental United States/OCONUS 

The Department of State Standardized Regulations (DSSR) is the controlling regulations for allowances and benefits available to all U.S. Government civilians assigned to foreign areas. OCOs are authorized to select a foreign area pricing approach consistent with the DSSR tailored to their order requirements.

If a Task Order Request For Proposal (TORFP) includes foreign area work and the OCO has not identified a preferred foreign area pricing approach, contractors may include a foreign area pricing approach consistent with the DSSR in their response to a TORFP. OCOs will determine if the approach results in a fair and reasonable price in accordance with the DSSR, FAR subpart 15.4, Contract Pricing, and FAR part 16, Types of Contracts as applicable. Upon request of the OCO, the contractor must provide data other than certified cost or pricing data (FAR 15.403-3) to support its task order proposal(s).

#### Classified Task Order Considerations

The task order solicitation should clearly express all requirements for security clearances, both facility, and personnel. Please adhere to all classified handling procedures at all times.

Example for Classified work:

1. Determine Contract Vehicle/Domain/NAICS code;
2. Notify the applicable contract holders of an upcoming classified solicitation via the mandatory task order solicitation system (Symphony); requests interested contractors to respond; include instructions for how the solicitation may be viewed; i.e., location (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) or Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) email instructions);
3. Post the solicitation in secure location (i.e., distribute via SIPR emails);
4. Review the offer and award task order; and
5. Notify GSA of the task order award by emailing [OASISplus@gsa.gov](mailto:OASISplus@gsa.gov) that an award has been made (a copy of the task order is not required to be attached to the email) and include the total amount of CAF applicable to the task order.

#### Small Business Considerations
##### Small Business Size and Socioeconomic Status

In accordance with [13 CFR 121.404(a)(1)(i)(B)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/chapter-I/part-121/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR0fca5207262de47/section-121.404#p-121.404(a)(1)(i)(B)), for all OASIS+ SB, OASIS+ HUBZone, OASIS+ SDVOSB, and OASIS+ WOSB task orders, a contractor’s business size and socioeconomic status defaults to their size/status shown in their OASIS+ master contract, notwithstanding their size/status shown in any other system at the time of task order award, unless an OCO requests a size recertification for a specific order.  See below for applicability specific to OASIS+ 8(a).

##### 8(a) SB Competitive and/or Sole Source
Ordering activities seeking to satisfy their requirements through either 8(a) competitive or 8(a) sole source (direct) task orders must use the OASIS+ 8(a) contract vehicle. 

##### Competitive OASIS+ 8(a) SB Task Orders
- Competitive task orders solicited and awarded under the OASIS+ 8(a) contract shall adhere to the following:
- Follow similar procedures to competing orders (e.g., choose the Domain and NAICS code).
- Competition at any dollar value.
- Include the SBA requirement number IX1685025756D, as all OASIS+ 8(a) SB master contracts have been offered to and the requirements have been accepted by SBA for the 8(a) program. There is no requirement for SBA acceptance to receive 8(a) credit for the task order.

##### Sole Source (Direct) OASIS+ 8(a) Task Orders

Sole source task orders solicited and awarded under the OASIS+ 8(a) contract shall adhere to the following:

- Sole source (direct) OASIS+ 8(a) task orders may be issued at the OCO’s discretion subject to the OCO receiving SBA approval prior to issuing an offer from an OASIS+ 8(a) company. Sole source 8(a) orders must each be offered to and accepted by SBA before award.
- The OCO should check the contractor’s 8(a) status at [SBA Dynamic Search](https://www.sba.gov/partners/contracting-officials/small-business-procurement) before considering a sole source order. Per [13 CFR 124.503(i)(1)(iv)(A)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/part-124/section-124.503#p-124.503(i)(1)(iv)(A)), a contractor must be a current 8(a) program participant at the time of task order award in order to receive a sole source order. 
- Contractors who have exited from the 8(a) program are ineligible to receive an 8(a) sole source task order award.
- Follow the OCO agencies’ [partnership agreement](https://www.sba.gov/document/support--sba-and-agencies-partnership-agreements) for offering the sole source order to SBA.
- Are limited to $4.5 million in accordance with [FAR 19.805-1(a)(2)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.805-1);
    * Except for 8(a) concerns owned by an Indian Tribe (Tribal Owned) or an Alaska Native Corporation (ANC) (reference [FAR 19.805-1(b)(2)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.805-1)), which have a sole source order limit of $25 million in accordance with [FAR 19.808-1](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.808-1).
    * DoD only:
        - DoD may also issue sole source orders to 8(a) Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHO) (reference 13 CFR 124.506(b)(2)).
        - [DFARS 219.808-1](https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/219.808-1-sole-source.) increases sole source order limit to $100 million for ANC/Tribal Owned/NHO 8(a) concerns.
##### Sole Source (Direct) OASIS+ 8(a)Task Orders to ANC/Tribal Owned/NHO 8(a) Concerns

Sole source task orders solicited and awarded to ANC/Tribal Owned/NHO 8(a) concerns under the OASIS+ 8(a) contract shall adhere to the following:

- Notwithstanding the OASIS+ 8(a) IDIQ contract was awarded competitively, [13 CFR 124.506 (b)(1) and (2)’s](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/chapter-I/part-124/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFRd1e9fd1d2f2a3ac/section-124.506#p-124.506(b)) “...if SBA has not accepted the requirement into the 8(a) BD program as a competitive procurement…” only applies to an order level requirement and may not be used as a rationale to prohibit allowing orders to ANC/Tribal/NHO 8(a) concerns on a sole source (direct) order basis above the [FAR 19.805-1(a)(2)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.805-1) $4.5 million threshold.
- An OASIS+ 8(a) order requirement that was initially solicited on a competitive basis may not be removed from competition and subsequently awarded to an ANC/Tribal/NHO 8(a) concern on a sole source (direct) order basis. 

#### Prohibited Actions Against/Under OASIS+ Contracts

**Prohibited Action: No IDIQ or Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) may be issued against any OASIS+ contract.**

Agencies may not issue an IDIQ order instrument or Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) against the OASIS+ IDIQ contracts (see [Harris IT Services Corporation B-411699,B-411796: Oct 2, 2015](https://www.gao.gov/products/b-411699%2Cb-411796#mt%3De-report)). However, considerable flexibility with respect to variable levels of effort and requirements can be achieved through the use of optional CLINs, T&M/LH CLINs, and cost-reimbursement type CLINs (e.g., issuing a not to exceed cost-reimbursement type order with a wide scope that is incrementally funded via “Technical Direction Letters” within the scope of the task order). OCOs seeking further guidance on these flexibilities are encouraged to submit a scope review outlining the desired flexibility.

**Prohibited Action: No further set-asides may be issued under any OASIS+ contract.**

OASIS+ includes five SB contracts that were awarded as 100% small business set-asides. Further setting aside to a subset of small businesses under any OASIS+ contract is prohibited. While small businesses may hold an OASIS+ UR Contract, it is explicitly prohibited to issue any small business set-aside task order solicitations under OASIS+ UR. Additionally, for example, it is expressly prohibited to issue an Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business set-aside under OASIS+ WOSB.

**Prohibited Action: No issuance of a task order solicitation to multiple OASIS+ contracts, OASIS+ Domains or NAICS codes simultaneously.**

An OCO may NOT issue a solicitation to multiple OASIS+ contracts at the same time (e.g., issuing the same solicitation to the OASIS+ UR contract under the Management and Advisory Domain with NAICS code 541611 and the OASIS+ SB contract under the Management and Advisory Domain with NAICS code 541611 simultaneously is prohibited), nor multiple Domains at the same time (e.g., issuing the same solicitation to the Technical & Engineering Domain and Environmental Services Domain), nor multiple NAICS codes at the same time (e.g., issuing the same solicitation to NAICS code 541330 and NAICS code 541715). 

**Prohibited Action: No new awards of a task order to a contractor in dormant status ([Section 3.4.3](#contracts-in-dormant-status)).**

### Step 3 - Solicitation Considerations

The OCO must consider the [Appendix B: Task Order Solicitation Methodology](#appendix-b-task-order-solicitation-methodology) and must create the task order solicitation within Symphony, consistent with [FAR 16.505](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.505) ordering procedures.

In addition to the information required by [FAR 16.505(a)(7)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.505), the following information is required to be provided within Symphony:

- Domain being solicited
- Master contract CLIN (applicable NAICS code)
- Task order Request for Proposal number
- Solicitation title
- Issuing agency and bureau
- Funding agency and bureau
- OCO name, email, and phone number
- Type of services (commercial or non-commercial)
- Contract type
- Task order CLIN structure
- SOW/PWS/SOO
- Product Service Code (PSC)
- Description of services
- Security clearances
- Labor categories/descriptions
- Extent of competition (fair opportunity, exception to fair opportunity)
- Invoicing Instructions
- Evaluation factors
- Source selection methodology
- Solicitation questions due date
- Proposal due date
- Proposal instructions
- Basis for award
- Other pertinent information (Ex. agency specific provisions/ clauses, optional clauses, etc.) 

#### OASIS+ Minimum and Maximum Order Limitations

Minimum Order 

- OASIS+ minimum order is the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT);
- When the government requires supplies or services covered by this contract in an amount of less than the SAT, as amended, the government is not obligated to purchase, nor is the contractor obligated to furnish, those supplies or services under the contract. 
- In accordance with Section C.2.5.1 of the OASIS+ UR contract, the minimum order threshold for task orders issued through the Enterprise Solutions Domain is $250 million total estimated value (including the base and all option periods).

Maximum Order

- Except for any limitations imposed by the FAR, there is no maximum order limitation under OASIS+; the OASIS+ program has no ceiling on any OASIS+ MAC.

#### Task Order Period of Performance Duration
OASIS+ has a five year base period of performance with one option period of five years that may extend the cumulative term of the contract to 10 years in accordance with [FAR 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.217-9), if exercised by the OASIS+ CO(s). The master contract also includes [FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.217-8), which may extend this period up to an additional six months, if exercised by the OASIS+ CO(s). Each OASIS+ master contract family has a unique ordering period of performance end date. 

The period of performance for each task order awarded under the master contract shall be specified in the task order by the ordering agency. Task orders must be solicited and awarded prior to the master contract’s term expiring and may extend up to five years and six months (which includes the extension at FAR 52.217-8 clause, if applicable) after the term’s expiration. 

Task order option periods may be exercised after the contract term expires as long as the final task order option period does not extend the cumulative term of the task order beyond five years and six months after the OASIS+ contract ordering term ends. 

After the contract ordering term expires, the master contract terms and conditions will be actively administered by the government and the contractor until the contractor’s final task order is closed out. Therefore, the master contract terms and conditions shall remain in effect with respect to all active task orders until the last task order is closed out. 

#### Contract Access Fee
GSA’s operating costs are reimbursed through a CAF charged on all task orders placed against the master contract(s). The CAF is paid by the ordering agency, but remitted to GSA by the contractor. GSA maintains the unilateral right to establish and change the CAF rate. GSA will provide at least a 60-day notice prior to the effective date of any change to the CAF rate or payment process. 

The OASIS+ CAF shall be included in each task order under a separate CLIN (e.g. a CAF CLIN for the base and a CAF CLIN for each option period). This CLIN should be established as a flexibly reimbursable no-fee CLIN. OCOs may use a different contract type for this CLIN; however, it is NOT recommended.

The CAF rate is a flat 0.15%, applied to the total amount billed on each invoice (including ancillary support, travel, and profit) for all task orders. 

Due to the low CAF rate, there are no Memorandums of Understanding with federal agencies that discount the established CAF rate; additionally, there is no cap/ceiling applicable to the CAF.

Using the established CAF rate, the contractor shall include the estimated CAF in each task order proposal based on the total estimated order value, which helps avoid potential funding issues. The contractor must include the CAF as a separate line item on all proposals and invoices to the government, regardless of contract type. The CAF is established by GSA, and must never be treated as a negotiable element between the contractor and the ordering agency. If the contractor does not ensure a separate CAF CLIN is included in its task order proposal and resulting task order award, the contractor shall still be liable to pay the owed CAF to the government. 

OCOs shall instruct contractors to bill for CAF on every invoice/voucher as a separate line item in accordance with the OASIS+ contract Section B.11 OASIS+ Contract Access Fee.

Each invoice billed under the task order shall include a separate CAF line item as in the following example:

| CAF line item | Cost |
| --------------| -----|
|CLIN 0001 Labor|$100.00|
|CLIN 0002 Material|$50.00|
|CLIN 0003 Travel|$50.00|
|Subtotal|$200.00|
|CLIN 0004 CAF (0.15% of subtotal)|$0.30|
|Total Invoice including CAF|$200.30|

#### Clauses and Provisions

Due to the various combinations of contract provisions/clauses which may be required for an individual task order based on the contract type, statement of work, dollar value, and other specific customer agency requirements, the OASIS+ IDIQ cannot predetermine all the contract provisions/clauses for future individual task orders. However, all ‘Required’ and ‘Required when Applicable’ provisions / clauses set forth in [FAR 52.301](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.301) automatically flow down to all orders, based on their specific contract type, statement of work, and dollar value. The Attachment J-5, OASIS+ Task Order Clause and Provision Matrix, applies to task orders, as applicable. If there is a conflict between task order terms and conditions and master contract terms and conditions, the master contract terms shall take precedence.

The OCO must include any FAR clauses in full text that need to be filled in (e.g. [FAR 52.217-9](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.217-9) applicable to orders with options).

#### DoD-Specific Clauses and Provisions

For task orders subject to DoD requirements, DoD provisions and clauses from the [DoD FAR Supplement (DFARS)](https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars) have been incorporated in Attachment J-4. If applicable, the OCO may use the Attachment J-4 to ensure the required DFARS provisions and clauses will flow down to the task order Level. The required provisions and clauses are updated through the version date indicated on the J-4 attachment. Alternate and supplemental provisions and clauses from Command-specific and/or DoD Component levels are not included and may be incorporated by the OCO into the specific solicitation and subsequent task order. The required DoD provisions and clauses are updated through the master contract version date indicated on the J-4 attachment. Should Attachment J-4 not reflect any updated DoD provision or clause at the time of task order solicitation or award, the OCOs may insert those required updated provisions or clauses into their task order. Periodically, during the term of the master contract, an update to Attachment J-4, may be executed on the master contract via a bilateral contract modification.

#### Department of Labor-Specific Clauses and Provisions

For task orders subject to SCLS or construction wage rate requirements, DoL provisions and clauses from [FAR part 22](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-22) have been incorporated in Attachment J-5. Only the applicable provisions and clauses shall flow down to the task order level. Alternate, supplemental, or agency-level provisions and clauses may be incorporated by the OCO into the specific solicitation and subsequent task order. Should this list not reflect any updated DoL provision or clause at the time of task order solicitation or award, the OCOs may insert those required updated provisions or clauses into their task order. Periodically, during the term of the master contract, an update to these DoL Required Provisions and Clauses may be executed on the master contract via a bilateral contract modification. 

#### CAS-Specific Clauses and Provisions
For task orders subject to CAS requirements, CAS provisions and clauses from [FAR part 30](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-30) have been incorporated in Attachment J-5. The OCO must identify the provisions/clauses in the task order solicitation and subsequent task order award, as applicable.

#### Ability One

The OASIS+ Program fully supports the subcontracting with Ability One contractors, where the services are included on the Ability One Procurement List. 

In accordance with FAR 8.005, the OCO shall, “Insert the clause at [FAR 52.208-9, Contractor Use of Mandatory Sources of Supply and Services](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.208-9), in solicitations and contracts that require a contractor to provide supplies or services for government use that are on the Procurement List maintained by the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.” For certain task orders where supplies are anticipated to be supplied for use by the government, the Procurement List maintained by the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is a mandatory source of supply and should be checked to see if these supplies are available from this source. 

Under DoD regulations, prime contractors are allowed to receive credit toward their small business subcontracting goals if they subcontract with qualified nonprofit agencies participating in the AbilityOne Program. (See [10 US Code 3903](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section3903&num=0&edition=prelim)).

### Step 4 - Solicitation Issuance Considerations

It is not allowable to solicit the same requirement under two different IDIQs (e.g. issuing a solicitation to OASIS+ UR and OASIS+ WOSB concurrently.) Refer to statute [41 USC 3302 (c)(2)(A)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:41%20section:3302%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title41-section3302)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true), which includes the requirement of fair notice with the intent to make the purchase. Additionally, if an OCO solicits from two separate IDIQs, then there is a violation of statute because each Domain under an OASIS+ IDIQ is independent from a Domain under another IDIQ. Also see [Section 3.1.11 Prohibited Actions Against/Under OASIS+ Contracts](#).

#### Methods of Issuing the Task Order Solicitation

OASIS+ uses [Symphony](https://oasis.app.cloud.gov/) and OASIS+ task order solicitations must be issued via Symphony (mandatory).

Symphony is a full lifecycle procurement Software as a Service (SaaS) allowing government organizations to manage complex contracts. Symphony ensures organizations are purchasing according to fair opportunity regulation, law, and/or governing rules. 

Symphony provides users increased transparency and integrity at both the master contract level and task order level. Symphony provides OASIS+ customers and OASIS+ contract holders an easy to use, highly secure, and efficient method to submit task order proposals, and capture information as a database of record for all stakeholders. Symphony will reduce the amount of time between order creation and award, which in turn fulfills customer requirements faster, thus decreasing the time spent on tedious tasks and allowing more time for complex decision making.

**Symphony users can (some actions may only be performed by an OCO with a DPA):**

- Review contractor information and capabilities;
- Create/release a Request for Information (RFI);
- Create/release a Request for Proposal (RFP)/solicitation; 
- Create RFI and RFP amendments; 
- Conduct Questions and Answers and monitor responses; 
- Receive offer proposals;
- Report task order award information.

**Important:**

- How to Complete Government Registration
- How to Set-Up Multi-Factor Authentication
- Frequently Asked Questions
- Symphony Helpdesk: client.support@apexlogic.com

Use of Symphony to broadcast the solicitation notice to all qualifying contract holders, under one contract vehicle, within one given Domain and CLIN (NAICS code) satisfies the “fair opportunity” notification requirement. For classified requirements, see [Section 3.1.9 Classified Task Order Considerations](). 

#### Off-Ramping 

GSA reserves the unilateral right to off-ramp non-performing contractors. Off-ramping methods may result from conditions such as: 

- Debarment, suspension, or ineligibility as defined in FAR subpart 9.4;
- Termination as defined in FAR part 49;
- Failure to meet the standards of performance, deliverables, or compliances;
- Failure to accept or conform to program-wide terms and/or conditions; and/or
- Taking any other action which may not be permitted under the master contract’s terms and conditions.

The OASIS+ CO may off-ramp the contractor by not exercising the option, terminating the contract, or canceling the contract.  Contract cancellation may occur at any time and for any reason by either the OASIS+ contractor or the government. 
#### Contracts in Dormant Status

The OASIS+ master contract(s) terms and conditions provide for contracts to be placed in dormant status, see OASIS+ contract section H.12 Dormant Status. While a contract is in dormant status, contractors are required to continue work on existing task orders, but are not eligible to compete for new task order awards under the contract that is in Dormant Status.

### Step 5 - Proposal Evaluation Considerations
OCOs should evaluate proposals based on the methodology stated in the task order solicitation to maintain fairness in the ordering process and mitigate protest risk. 

#### Price
The OCO is responsible for analyzing task order proposals and documenting their cost or price analysis to include a determination that the final agreed-upon price is fair and reasonable at the task order level. To the maximum extent practicable, price analysis should be based on competition.

OASIS+ Master Contract Ceiling Rates:

- Except for sole source T&M/LH orders as detailed in the OASIS+ Prices section, in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(3), price rates are determined fair and reasonable at the task order level.

#### Evaluation Factors

In accordance with [FAR 16.505(b)(1)(ii)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.505), “The contracting officer may exercise broad discretion in developing appropriate order placement procedures. The contracting officer should keep submission requirements to a minimum. Contracting officers may use streamlined procedures, including oral presentations.”

The source selection procedures in [FAR Part 15.3](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-15.3) do not apply when using the procedures of FAR 16.505 Ordering (when providing for fair opportunity). The task order solicitation and award process should be as streamlined as practical to reduce solicitation and proposal preparation costs and time for both the government and contractor.

### Step 6 - Task Order Award Considerations
OCOs are required to use Symphony to report award information for any task orders awarded under OASIS+. 

#### Task Order Award Information
Symphony task order solicitation methodology information is available at [Appendix B: Task Order Solicitation Methodology](). Symphony will require the reporting of information not collected as part of the solicitation process that is known only upon award of a task order. OCOs accepting proposals via Symphony and issuing award notices via Symphony will benefit from having less information to report than OCO’s who accept proposals and issue awards external to Symphony. 

OCOs are requested to verify solicitation information input into Symphony, and correct as needed, prior to reporting any award information. Information required to be reported in Symphony includes:

- Task order number
- Awarded contractor’s name
- Awarded contractor’s Unique Entity IDentifier (UEID)
- Task order award date
- Period of Performance beginning and estimated ultimate completion dates
- Initial obligated dollar value
- Total estimated value
- Commercial or noncommercial type task order
- FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting included at the task order level

#### Public Notice of Awards with Exceptions to Fair Opportunity

For orders based on an exception to fair opportunity, in accordance with [FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.505), the OCO must post the required public notice within 14 days after placing the order. If exception (A) (urgency-unacceptable delay) is used, the public notice must be posted within 30 days after placing the order. This posting requirement includes posting the justification approved for the exception at the [System for Award Management](https://sam.gov/content/home). 

Note the actions excluded from this notice requirement are:

- Disclosures that would compromise national security, and
- Socioeconomic set-asides authorized by [FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.505).

#### Task Order Level Protests

Task order protests are the responsibility of the specific agency which solicited the task order (GSA is only responsible for GSA-solicited task order protests.) [FAR 16.505 (a)(10)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.505) prohibits protests under [FAR subpart 33.1](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-33.1) in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of task orders or delivery order contract, except for:

- A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period of performance, or maximum value of the contract; or
- For agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, a protest of an order valued in excess of $10 million ([41 U.S.C. 4106(f)](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title41-section4106(f)&num=0&edition=prelim)); or
- For DoD, NASA, or the Coast Guard, a protest of an order valued in excess of $25 million ([10 U.S.C. 3406(f)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3406)).

#### NAICS Code Appeals

The OASIS+ NAICS code chosen by the OCO from [Appendix A](#appendix-a-performance-areas---domains) representing the principal purpose of a task order may be appealed in accordance with [FAR 19.103](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.103). 

#### Ombudsman

In accordance with [GSAM/R 516.505 (b)](https://www.acquisition.gov/gsam/516.505): The [GSA Task Order and Delivery Order Ombudsman](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/gsa-ombudsman) shall review and resolve complaints from contractors concerning all task and delivery order actions made by GSA.

Complaints regarding task and delivery order actions of other agencies using GSA contract vehicles shall be directed to the ordering agency’s Task Order and Delivery Order Ombudsman. For orders issued by any other ordering activity, refer to the agency specific Ombudsman.

#### Reporting Task Order Awards in FPDS

Contract actions are reported in the FPDS within three (3) days after execution of the action. It is important that each OASIS+ task order is reported as an order under the respective OASIS+ master contract number. Each OASIS+ contractor may have multiple OASIS+ contract numbers depending on how many IDIQ contracts they were awarded.  

Double check that the FPDS report accurately reflects the appropriate values in all fields, in particular those related to award data, fair opportunity procedures used, and number of offers received.

The FPDS system will propagate the NAICS code field in the task order action report with the NAICS code reported for the indefinite delivery vehicle (IDV, i.e., IDIQ) contract. Refer to Appendix A for additional information.

### Step 7 - Contract Administration Considerations
The OCO should consider the following for task order contract administration:

#### Reassigning Task Orders for Administration
OASIS+ task orders can only be reassigned for administration to the awarding agency’s OCOs who have been issued an OASIS+ DPA. Agencies should plan for workforce turnover and development of qualified OCOs to administer task orders. GSA will work with agencies to expedite training and DPA issuance when personnel turnover is sudden and unexpected.

#### Quality Assurance – Contractor Surveillance

The OCO is responsible for ensuring contractor performance meets the minimum requirements established in the task order, documenting the order file, and communicating with the contractor to ensure the government is receiving the contracted services. 

#### OASIS+ UR Subcontracting Plans

Subcontracting plans are incorporated into OASIS+ UR IDIQ contracts awarded to Other Than Small Business concerns, and administered at the master contract level. An OCO may establish small business goals at the order level in accordance with [FAR 19.705-1(b)(2)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.705-1). but may NOT establish a new subcontracting plan.

The following subcontracting goals were included in the OASIS+ UR solicitation as a target:

| Category | Percent of Planned Subcontracted Dollars |
| --------------| -----|
|Total Small Business|50|
|Small Disadvantaged Business|7|
|WOSB|7|
|HUBZone|3|
|VOSB |3|
|SDVOSB|3|

Each OASIS+ UR contract has its own unique Subcontracting Plan. 

#### Performance Evaluation

Each OCO is responsible for ensuring that the contractors’ performance on each order is reported in the CPARS in accordance with the policies in [FAR subpart 42.15](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-42.15). Follow the OCO’s agency procedures for preparation, review, and submission of performance reports. 

#### Task Order Closeout

Task order files shall be closed out by the OCO in accordance with [FAR 4.804](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/4.804) and agency specific policies/guidance. The OCO shall email [oasisplusmods@gsa.gov](mailto:oasisplusmods@gsa.gov) within 30 days after task order closeout to report the task order has been closed out.  

## Appendix A: Performance Areas - Domains

OASIS+ Domains contain multiple NAICS codes. [FAR 19.102](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.102) requires the OCO to determine the appropriate NAICS code and related small business size standard and include them in all solicitations above the micro-purchase threshold. [FAR 19.102(b)(1)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.102) requires that the NAICS code assigned describe the principal nature of the service being acquired. 

The primary NAICS code for all OASIS+ UR contracts will be selected and assigned based on the smallest size standard within its awarded Domains. When the OASIS+ CO assigns a primary NAICS Code, receipts-based size standards take precedence over NAICS codes based on employees. This primary NAICS code will be reflected in each awarded contract and associated FPDS record. However, assignment of a primary NAICS code does not limit contractors’ eligibility to respond to task order solicitations or perform work outside of the NAICS assigned as their primary NAICS on their contract. Contractors will be eligible to compete within all awarded Domain CLINs (NAICS codes), which represent the contractor’s specific fair opportunity pools. 

The primary NAICS code for all OASIS+ SB contracts will be selected and assigned based on the largest size standard within its awarded Domains. When the OASIS+ CO assigns a primary NAICS code, employee-based size standards take precedence over NAICS codes based on annual receipts. 

This is critical to ensure contractors are not locked out of Domain fair opportunity during re-representation in accordance with Section G.3.1.7.2, as long as they are otherwise eligible based on their size standard at time of re-representation. 
For administrative purposes only, the six OASIS+ solicitations are assigned a single NAICS code (541990) which represents the preponderance scope of the OASIS+ Contract Program as a whole. This is not the NAICS that will be reported at the task order level.
FPDS is currently designed to accept only one NAICS code to be associated with a procurement action. This is simply a limitation of the FPDS system and has no bearing on individual task order NAICS code assignments. The OASIS+ process of NAICS code assignment at the individual master contract level is for administrative purposes, and will ensure proper socioeconomic and size status reporting at the task order level. Due to a limitation with the FPDS, only a single NAICS code may be assigned to a contract and subsequently reported with each contract action (i.e., task order); therefore, each contractor will be assigned a single primary NAICS code to its master contract based on its awarded Domains. This primary NAICS code will be reflected in each awarded contract and associated FPDS record. However, assignment of a primary NAICS code does not limit contractors’ eligibility to respond to task order solicitations or perform work outside of the NAICS assigned as their primary NAICS on their contract. contractors will be eligible to compete within all awarded Domain CLINs (NAICS codes), which represent the contractor’s specific fair opportunity pools. Fair opportunity will be managed in the OSP, which will be the mandatory, sole system for OCOs to issue task order solicitations. The contractor will only be included in and allowed to compete under the NAICS codes where they are represented (and subsequently re-represent) as a small business concern for the corresponding size standard, and are otherwise eligible under the socioeconomic contract.

This Domain is for the procurement of highly technical, new and emerging and/or specialized mission objectives that require special management attention, and oversight because of the importance to the agency mission; high-level development, operating, or maintenance costs; high risk; high return; or their significant role in the administration of agency-wide programs, systems, finances, property, or other resources. This Domain also includes non-IT services in support of national security systems in accordance with 40 USC § 11103(a). 

The Enterprise Solutions Domain is focused on requirements that are large-dollar, wide-reaching (e.g., across one organization, agency or multiple organizations and/or agencies) and highly complex in scope. By design, this Domain shares overlapping NAICS with other Domains within OASIS+. This Domain includes contractors who are able to manage vast projects with the potential of (but not limited to) the following highly specialized project requirements: 

- Multi-layered subcontracting teams
- High touch/high accountability in the areas of contractor acquired or contractor managed government Property
- Vast accounting system, estimating system, and invoicing demands
- Stringent quality control and government quality assurance oversight and accountability
- Geographically dispersed project offices (on the government site, or the contractor site)
- Requirements for extensive upfront capital to launch, transition into, and/or sustain for long periods of time due to the high-capital-demand value to launch and sustain business operations in support of an agency mission requirement(s). 

The minimum order threshold for future task orders issued through this Domain is $250 Million total estimated value (including the base and all option periods).
