The OCO should consider the following requirements and factors when managing task order contract aministration.

## Reassigning task orders for administration

OASIS+ task orders can only be reassigned for administration to the awarding agency’s OCOs who have been issued an OASIS+ DPA. Agencies should plan for workforce turnover and development of qualified OCOs to administer task orders. GSA will work with agencies to expedite training and DPA issuance when personnel turnover is sudden and unexpected.

## Quality assurance – contractor surveillance
The OCO is responsible for ensuring contractor performance meets the minimum requirements established in the task order, documenting the order file, and communicating with the contractor to ensure the government is receiving the contracted services. 

## OASIS+ UR subcontracting plans

Subcontracting plans are incorporated into OASIS+ UR IDIQ contracts awarded to Other Than Small Business concerns, and administered at the master contract level. An OCO may establish small business goals at the order level in accordance with [FAR 19.705-1(b)(2)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.705-1). but may NOT establish a new subcontracting plan.

The following subcontracting goals were included in the OASIS+ UR solicitation as a target:

| Category | Percent of Planned Subcontracted Dollars|
| --------------------------| -----------------------|
|Total Small Business|50|
|Small Disadvantaged Business|7|
|WOSB|7|
|HUBZone|3|
|VOSB|3|
|SDVOSB|3|

Each OASIS+ UR contract has its own unique Subcontracting Plan. 

## Performance evaluation

Each OCO is responsible for ensuring that the contractors’ performance on each order is reported in the CPARS in accordance with the policies in [FAR subpart 42.15](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-42.15). Follow the OCO’s agency procedures for preparation, review, and submission of performance reports. 

## Task order closeout

Task order files shall be closed out by the OCO in accordance with [FAR 4.804](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/4.804) and agency specific policies/guidance. The OCO shall email [oasisplusmods@gsa.gov](mailto:oasisplusmods@gsa.gov) within 30 days after task order closeout to report the task order has been closed out.
