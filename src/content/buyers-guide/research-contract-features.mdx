As part of market research, you will need to determine which OASIS+ vehicle will be solicited. The information below is required by the FAR, necessary for you to complete your contract file.  Agencies may have different policies, regulations, and standards that should be considered in the decision to utilize OASIS+ for an agency solution. 

## Contract Scope

The contract scope of OASIS+ is organized by Domains, which are functional groupings of related services spanning multiple NAICS codes. Domains are designed to align order requirements to qualified industry partners. Each Domain is limited to the NAICS codes and associated size standards specifically listed under that Domain. 

The OASIS+ contracts cover services that are: commercial and non-commercial; classified and unclassified; and Continental United States or CONUS and OCONUS or Outside the Continental United States. All OASIS+ task orders must be within scope of the respective OASIS+ IDIQ contract for which it is awarded, provided the Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) determines the principal purpose NAICS code for the order to be one of the OASIS+ NAICS codes (see Appendix A). If the OCO determines it is a NAICS code outside one of the OASIS+ NAICS codes, it is not within scope of OASIS+.

As you continue to review the factors that determine which OASIS+ contract to use, OCO's seeking further guidance are encouraged to [submit a scope review] (#)

## Services not allowed

OASIS+ task orders shall NOT include any of the following:

- Any requirement for Inherently Governmental Functions as defined in FAR 2.101.
- Any requirement for Personal Services as defined in FAR 2.101.
- Any requirement whose principal purpose - as determined by the OCO - falls under the scope of FAR part 36 - Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts. (Note: This does not preclude use of Architects and Engineers for services not required to be under FAR Part 36 such as Construction Management, etc.)
- Any requirement whose principal purpose - as determined by the OCO - is in a NAICS code not listed under the corresponding Domain solicited. 

## Task order contract types

Subject to the FAR and agency level required consideration criteria, limitations, and/or prohibitions, OCOs may use any appropriate contract type. These generally include, but are not limited to:
- Fixed-price, all types
- Cost-reimbursement, all types
- Time-and-materials
- Labor-hour
- Hybrids of any of these types

If using a hybrid of contract types, please use separate Contract Line Item Numbers or CLINs for the work under each contract type and annotate each CLIN with the associated contract type. This is important for clause implementation.

## Task order period of performances

A task order must be solicited and awarded prior to the OASIS+ IDIQ ordering period end date. A task order period of performance (base period and all option periods) may extend up to five years after the OASIS+ IDIQ contract ordering period end date. Task order option periods may be exercised after the OASIS+ ordering period end date, provided that no task order option period of performance occurs beyond five years after the OASIS+ IDIQ ordering period end date. No task order performance can occur after the period of performance end date for the OASIS+ IDIQ.
