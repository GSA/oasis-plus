One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services Plus (OASIS+) is a suite of governmentwide, multi-award contracts designed to support federal agencies’ procurement requirements for services-based solutions. This suite of services contracts is available for use by agencies throughout the Federal Government who hold a Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA).

OASIS+ is a collection of multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, of which the contract base period is five (5) years with one (1) option period of five (5) years that may extend the cumulative contract ordering period to 10 years. Task orders can be awarded under OASIS+ any time prior to the expiration of the ordering period of the master contracts. Notwithstanding, the OASIS+ IDIQ master contracts (contractor specific) can have different award dates; however, all contracts for each specific MAC have the same contract end dates (e.g., all of the Small Business contracts will end on the same date).

OASIS+ contracts may be used by all federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD) and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), but are not open to state and local governments at this time. 

Orders issued against the OASIS+ contracts are considered Interagency Acquisitions. GSA has specific statutory authority under [40 U.S.C. 501](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title%3A40%20section%3A501%20edition%3Aprelim)%20OR%20(granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title40-section501)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) to purchase supplies and non-personal services on behalf of other agencies. Therefore, the [Economy Act](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/17.502-2) does not apply to OASIS+ orders.

## A streamlined program with expanded offerings

Under the OASIS+ program, this suite of contracts combines the scope of legacy OASIS, Building Maintenance & Operations (BMO), and Human Capital & Training Solutions (HCaTS), along with new areas of service that were previously not in scope. It expands the range of service offerings for buyers and gives sellers a greater variety of areas they can compete for.

GSA is responsible for the award, administration, and management of the OASIS+ IDIQ contracts; there will always be a Requiring Activity (agency requesting services) and an Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) (person who performs the acquisition). OASIS+ will enable federal customers to acquire innovative solutions from highly qualified businesses on a contract vehicle designed to be [Best-in-Class (BIC):](https://acquisitiongateway.gov/Category-management/resources/4163) a governmentwide designation that satisfies key criteria defined by the Office of Management and Budget which allows sellers to offer an expanded variety of services.

## GSA eBuy procurement tool

Upon award of OASIS+ contracts, GSA eBuy will be the required task order solicitation tool. GSA eBuy provides ordering contracting officers and industry partners a centralized portal with real-time, automated responses when solicitations are issued, increasing acquisition efficiency and transparency. In addition, GSA eBuy provides program and contract management tools that mitigate risks associated with fair opportunity by streamlining management and oversight. In the coming weeks, you will notice updates to the OASIS+ website reflecting the transition from Symphony to GSA eBuy. 

For OASIS+ customers, GSA eBuy will provide the capability to: 
- Review awarded vendors
- Submit RFIs via GSA’s [MRAS Program](https://buy.gsa.gov/mras)
- Submit RFIs, RFPs and amendments
- Manage task orders from solicitation to task order award
- Provide a secure environment to release information only to OASIS+ contract holders

For OASIS+ industry partners, GSA eBuy serves as a single location to receive solicitations providing the capability to:
- View solicitations/RFIs/RFPs released via GSA eBuy all in one place
- Maintain/update email POC for automated email notifications
- Respond to RFIs/RFPs and [MRAS](https://buy.gsa.gov/mras) requests
- Submit proposals securely and directly to the buying agency
- Receive automated notifications
- Act as a repository for historical solicitation documents going forward

Training is available to help you register, navigate, and use the tool:

## Built for the future

OASIS+ represents a bold step by GSA to innovate on the successes and opportunities gleaned from the OASIS program over the years; drawing on these learnings, we are building a more robust suite of Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the next generation of professional services solutions, that will be flexible enough to meet federal customers’ increasingly complex requirements.

OASIS+ is flexible, easy to use, and allows ordering activities to solicit and/or award orders in a streamlined, high quality manner.
The benefits of OASIS+ include:
- Task orders that may be: 
  - Awarded against six contracts that have no contract ceiling or cap on awards;
  - For work performed in CONUS and/or OCONUS locations;
  - For complex commercial or non-commercial services;
  - For any contract type, including hybrid mix and structures of Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) types tailored to individual task order requirements;
- Open on-ramping; after the initial phase of awards, the solicitation for OASIS+ will remain continuously open, allowing potential industry partners to obtain OASIS+ contracts at any time as long as they qualify;
- Flexible/expandable Domain-based structure; ability to add Domains based on government need;
- A cumulative ordering period of 10 years;
- Technology-based ordering and market research tools;
- Access to an industrial base of highly qualified contractors;
- Ancillary services and Other Direct Costs (ODCs) defined as integral and necessary to complete a total integrated solution under a requirement are within the scope of the master contract;
- Access transactional data and data analytics for spend analysis and market research;
- Save time without having to complete the following, which have already been completed at the OASIS+ master contract level;
  - [FAR subpart 9.1](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-9.1) responsibility determinations;
  - General Services Administration Manual/ Regulation [(GSAM/R) 505.303-70](https://www.acquisition.gov/gsam/505.303-70) congressional notifications; however, the ordering agency specific policies will still be applicable/required.
### OASIS+ will:

- **Fulfill federal agencies' non-IT services requirements** through highly qualified contractors and a simpler buying experience: all task order solicitations now happen through a single platform, GSA eBuy.
- **Expand access to Best-in-Class non-IT service contracts** for highly qualified contractors by providing increased small business opportunities and an improved selling experience.
- **Encourage competition among services contractors** to provide best value mission outcomes.
- **Maximize small business participation** by removing barriers to entry and helping customer agencies acquire the best professional services solutions to meet their requirements.
