The OASIS+ family of contracts builds on the success of the OASIS and OASIS Small Business (OASIS SB) contracts, offering federal agencies access to highly qualified contractors for their comprehensive and complex non-IT services solutions worldwide.

##  OASIS+ will continue to: 
- Designated by OMB as Best-in-Class contract that helps agencies meet their spend under management goals.
- Provide a single solution for complex requirements.
- Support multiple technical disciplines and mission spaces.
- Support commercial and non-commercial acquisition.
- Support all contract types, including hybrids and cost-reimbursement, at the task order level.
- Allow ancillary support components, commonly referred to as other direct costs (ODCs) at the task order level.
- Allow performance in CONUS and/or OCONUS locations.
- Use FAR 15, Contracting by Negotiation for solicitation procedures at Master Contract Level.
