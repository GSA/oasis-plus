The contract scope of OASIS+ is organized by domains, functional grouping of related services. Each domain contains multiple [North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)](https://www.census.gov/naics/) codes. We will release domains in phases: there are eight domains that comprise the scope of the initial Phase I. We have included a list of NAICS codes for Phase I domains below, and will continue to build on this list when we release Phase II.

**Determining the appropriate primary NAICS code**

OASIS+ domains contain multiple NAICS codes. FAR 19.102 requires the OCO to determine the appropriate NAICS code and related small business size standard and include them in all solicitations above the micro-purchase threshold. FAR 19.102(b)(1) requires that the NAICS code assigned describe the principal nature of the service being acquired.

The primary NAICS code for all OASIS+ UR contracts will be selected and assigned based on the smallest size standard within its awarded Domains. When the OASIS+ CO assigns a primary NAICS Code, receipts-based size standards take precedence over NAICS codes based on employees. This primary NAICS code will be reflected in each awarded contract and associated FPDS record. However, assignment of a primary NAICS code does not limit contractors’ eligibility to respond to task order solicitations or perform work outside of the NAICS assigned as their primary NAICS on their contract. Contractors will be eligible to compete within all awarded Domain CLINs (NAICS codes), which represent the contractor’s specific fair opportunity pools.

The primary NAICS code for all OASIS+ SB contracts will be selected and assigned based on the largest size standard within its awarded Domains. When the OASIS+ CO assigns a primary NAICS code, employee-based size standards take precedence over NAICS codes based on annual receipts. This is critical to ensure contractors are not locked out of Domain fair opportunity during re-representation in accordance with Section G.3.1.7.2, as long as they are otherwise eligible based on their size standard at time of re-representation. 

**Understanding primary-level NAICS codes vs task order-level NAICS codes**

For administrative purposes only, the six OASIS+ solicitations are assigned a single NAICS code (541990) which represents the preponderance scope of the OASIS+ Contract Program as a whole. This is not the NAICS that will be reported at the task order level. 

FPDS is currently designed to accept only one NAICS code to be associated with a procurement action. This is simply a limitation of the FPDS system and has no bearing on individual task order NAICS code assignments. The OASIS+ process of NAICS code assignment at the individual master contract level is for administrative purposes, and will ensure proper socioeconomic and size status reporting at the task order level. Due to a limitation with the FPDS, only a single NAICS code may be assigned to a contract and subsequently reported with each contract action (i.e., task order); therefore, each contractor will be assigned a single primary NAICS code to its master contract based on its awarded Domains. This primary NAICS code will be reflected in each awarded contract and associated FPDS record. However, assignment of a primary NAICS code does not limit contractors’ eligibility to respond to task order solicitations or perform work outside of the NAICS assigned as their primary NAICS on their contract. contractors will be eligible to compete within all awarded Domain CLINs (NAICS codes), which represent the contractor’s specific fair opportunity pools. Fair opportunity will be managed in the OSP, which will be the mandatory, sole system for OCOs to issue task order solicitations. The contractor will only be included in and allowed to compete under the NAICS codes where they are represented (and subsequently re-represent) as a small business concern for the corresponding size standard, and are otherwise eligible under the socioeconomic contract.

Work under this Domain typically involves the application of physical laws and principles of engineering in the design; development, and utilization of machines, materials, instruments, processes, and systems; and providing expert advice and assistance on technical functions and issues. Technical and Engineering Domain scope areas include, but are not limited to:
</NAICSDomainTable>

<NAICSDomainTable shortName="R&D">
  This Domain includes any requirements in support of Research and Development (R&D) activities. R&D activities may be aimed at achieving either specific or general objectives. The term R&D includes basic research, applied research and experimental development. Services include conducting R&D in: the physical, engineering and life sciences, Nanotechnology, Biotechnology and social sciences and humanities. The R&D Domain scope areas include, but are not limited to:

<NAICSDomainTable shortName="INTEL">
    This Domain focuses on Command, Control, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance mission requirements. Organizational and Technological capabilities improve situational awareness and enhance command and control strategies within defense and intelligence environments. Intelligence Services Domain scope areas include, but are not limited to:
</NAICSDomainTable>

<NAICSDomainTable shortName="ENV">
    This Domain supports agencies in meeting their environmental requirements and streamlining the contracting process by providing a faster, more cost-efficient means to meet environmental objectives. Requirements typically involve multi disciplined teams of scientists, engineers, and other technicians with expertise in areas, such as air and water quality, climate change, asbestos contamination, remediation, ecological restoration, and environmental law. Environmental consulting could consist of support such as Planning and Documentation Services for the development, facilitation, and coordination of and/or for environmental initiatives or mandates in areas of chemical, radiological, and/or hazardous materials. Environmental Domain scope areas include, but are not limited to:

<NAICSDomainTable shortName="FAC">
    Services in this Domain include any and all services required to maintain and operate buildings, paved services, utilities infrastructure, and real property assets and equipment. This could include major facilities support such as DoD installations, hospitals, cemeteries, and other Federal or industrial real property, but does not include major/primary purpose construction. GSA has included a wide range of services found in facilities contracts because of their historical use to support total facilities solutions. Facilities Domain scope areas include, but are not limited to:

<NAICSDomainTable shortName="ENT">
This Domain is for the procurement of highly technical, new and emerging and/or specialized mission objectives that require special management attention, and oversight because of the importance to the agency mission; high-level development, operating, or maintenance costs; high risk; high return; or their significant role in the administration of agency-wide programs, systems, finances, property, or other resources. This Domain also includes non-IT services in support of national security systems in accordance with 40 USC § 11103(a).

The Enterprise Solutions Domain is focused on requirements that are large-dollar, wide-reaching (e.g., across one organization, agency or multiple organizations and/or agencies) and highly complex in scope. By design, this Domain shares overlapping NAICS with other Domains within OASIS+. This Domain includes contractors who are able to manage vast projects with the potential of (but not limited to) the following highly specialized project requirements:
