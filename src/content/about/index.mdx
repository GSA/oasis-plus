One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services Plus (OASIS+) is a suite of governmentwide, multi-award contracts designed to support federal agencies’ procurement requirements for services-based solutions.

## A streamlined program with expanded offerings

Under the OASIS+ program, this suite of contracts combines the scope of legacy OASIS, Building Maintenance & Operations (BMO), and Human Capital & Training Solutions (HCaTS), along with new areas of service that were previously not in scope. It expands the range of service offerings for buyers and gives sellers a greater variety of areas they can compete for.

GSA is responsible for the award, administration, and management of the OASIS+ IDIQ contracts; there will always be a Requiring Activity (agency requesting services) and an Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) (person who performs the acquisition). OASIS+ will enable federal customers to acquire innovative solutions from highly qualified businesses on a contract vehicle designed to be [Best-in-Class (BIC):](https://acquisitiongateway.gov/Category-management/resources/4163) a governmentwide designation that satisfies key criteria defined by the Office of Management and Budget which allows sellers to offer an expanded variety of services.

## eBuy procurement tool

Upon award of OASIS+ contracts, eBuy will be the required task order management system. eBuy provides ordering contracting officers and industry partners a centralized portal with real-time, automated responses when solicitations are issued, increasing acquisition efficiency and transparency. In addition, eBuy provides program and contract management tools that mitigate risks associated with fair opportunity by streamlining management and oversight. In the coming weeks, you will notice updates to the OASIS+ website reflecting the transition from Symphony to eBuy. 

For OASIS+ customers, eBuy will provide the capability to: 
- Review awarded vendors
- Submit RFIs via GSA’s [MRaS Program](https://buy.gsa.gov/mras)
- Submit RFIs, RFPs and amendments
- Manage task orders from solicitation to task order award
- Provide a secure environment to release information only to OASIS+ contract holders

For OASIS+ industry partners, eBuy serves as a single location to receive solicitations providing the capability to:
- View solicitations/RFIs/RFPs released via eBuy all in one place
- Maintain/update email POC for automated email notifications
- Submit proposals securely and directly to the buying agency
- Receive automated notifications
- Act as a repository for historical solicitation documents going forward

Training is available to help you register, navigate, and use the tool:

## Built for the future

OASIS+ represents a bold step by GSA to innovate on the successes and opportunities gleaned from the OASIS program over the years; drawing on these learnings, we are building a more robust suite of Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the next generation of professional services solutions, that will be flexible enough to meet federal customers’ increasingly complex requirements.

### OASIS+ will:

- **Fulfill federal agencies' non-IT services requirements** through highly qualified contractors and a simpler buying experience: all task order management now happens through a single platform, eBuy.
- **Expand access to Best-in-Class non-IT service contracts** for highly qualified contractors by providing increased small business opportunities and an improved selling experience.
- **Encourage competition among services contractors** to provide best value mission outcomes.
- **Maximize small business participation** by removing barriers to entry and helping customer agencies acquire the best professional services solutions to meet their requirements.
