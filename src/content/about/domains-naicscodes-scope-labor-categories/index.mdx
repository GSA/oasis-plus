The contract scope is organized by domains and North American Industry Classification System or NAICS codes.

**Domains:**

The contract scope is organized by domains or functional groupings of related services spanning multiple NAICs codes. Domains and the NAICS codes listed under the domains are designed to align order requirements to qualified industry partners. Each domain is limited to the NAICS codes and associated size standards specifically listed under that domain.

**NAICS codes:**

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the standard used by federal statistical agencies in classifying entity establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

## Scope

The OASIS+ contracts cover services that are: primarily noncommercial, with the allowance for commercial services task orders classified and unclassified; and within the Continental US (CONUS) and Outside the Continental US (OCONUS). All OASIS+ task orders must be within scope of the respective OASIS+ [IDIQ contract](/about/contract-families/) for which it is awarded, provided the Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) determines the principal purpose NAICS code for the order to be one of the OASIS+ [NAICS codes](/about/domains-naicscodes-scope-labor-categories/naics-codes/). If the OCO determines its requirement has a NAICS code outside one of the OASIS+ NAICS codes, the requirement is not within scope of OASIS+.

### ![A wrench and screwdriver](/images/domain-icons/facilities.svg) Facilities (FAC)

Services in this domain include any and all services required to maintain and operate buildings, paved services, utilities infrastructure, and real property assets and equipment. This could include major facilities support such as Department of Defense installations, hospitals, cemeteries, and other federal or industrial real property, but does not include major or primary purpose construction. GSA has included a wide range of services found in facilities contracts because of their historical use to support total facilities solutions.

### ![A building with a group of people in front](/images/domain-icons/enterprise.svg) Enterprise Solutions

This domain is focused on requirements that are large-dollar, wide-reaching, and highly complex in scope, often spanning multiple disciplines and/or locations, and requiring many different types of labor and expertise. It is for the procurement of highly technical, new and emerging and/or specialized mission objectives that require special management attention, and oversight because of:
- the importance to the agency mission;
- the high-level development, operating, or maintenance costs;
- the high risk;
- the high return; or
- their significant role in the administration of agency-wide programs, systems, finances, property, or other resources.

This domain also includes non-IT services in support of national security systems in accordance with 40 USC § 11103(a). By design, this domain shares overlapping NAICS with other domains within OASIS+.

The enterprise solutions domain will only be available for the Unrestricted contract.

## Scope for Information Technology & Non-Information Technology

### What’s in scope / out of scope

Information Technology (IT), by definition, means any equipment, or interconnected system(s) or subsystem(s) of equipment that is used for the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the agency. For purposes of this definition, if the equipment is used by the agency directly or is used by a contractor under a contract with the agency that requires its use, or to a significant extent, its use in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.

IT is considered an ancillary support service or product on the Domains, and may be performed only when the service or product is integral and necessary to complete a total integrated solution. “Non-IT” includes any service or equipment that is acquired by a Contractor incidental to a contract or contains embedded IT that is used as an integral part of the service or product, but the principal function of which is not the acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. (For example, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment, such as thermostats or temperature control devices, and medical equipment where IT is integral to its operation, is non-IT).

Non-IT also includes any equipment or services related to a National Security System in accordance with [40 USC § 11103 (a)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:40%20section:11103%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title40-section11103)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true). The term “National Security System” means a telecommunications or information system operated by the Federal Government, the function, operation, or use of which involves intelligence activities, cryptologic activities related to national security, command and control of military forces, equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or, is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions, not including a system to be used for routine administrative and business applications (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications).

Non-IT may include embedded IT components including software, IT hardware, and other items and services traditionally considered IT on IT requirements.

Non-IT professional services are not considered ancillary support services. Non-IT professional services are considered to be within the primary scope of the Domains.

## Labor categories

OASIS+ labor categories align to the Office of Management and Budget’s [Standard Occupational Classification Manual 2018](https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/soc_2018_manual.pdf), which includes compensation data maintained by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Federal agencies use the Standard Occupational Classification system, a federal statistical standard, to classify workers into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, or disseminating data.
