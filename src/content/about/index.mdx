One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services Plus (OASIS+) is a suite of governmentwide, multi-award contracts designed to support federal agencies’ procurement requirements for services-based solutions. 

## A streamlined program with expanded offerings

This suite of contracts combines the scope of legacy OASIS – Building Maintenance &
Operations and Human Capital & Training Solutions – under one program, along with new areas of service that were previously not in scope. It expands the range of service offerings for buyers and gives sellers a greater variety of areas they can compete for.

GSA is responsible for the award, administration, and management of the OASIS+ IDIQ contracts; there will always be a Requiring Activity (agency requesting services) and an Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) (person who performs the acquisition). OASIS+ will enable federal customers to acquire innovative solutions from highly qualified businesses on a contract vehicle designed to be [Best-in-Class (BIC):](https://acquisitiongateway.gov/Category-management/resources/4163) a governmentwide designation that satisfies key criteria defined by the Office of Management and Budget which allows sellers to offer an expanded variety of services.

## Built for the future 

OASIS+ represents a bold step by GSA to innovate on the successes and opportunities gleaned from the OASIS program over the years; drawing on these learnings, we are building a more robust suite of Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the next generation of professional services solutions, that will be flexible enough to meet federal customers’ increasingly complex requirements.

### OASIS+ will:

- **Fulfill federal agencies' non-IT services requirements** through highly qualified contractors and a simpler buying experience: all task order management now happens through a single platform, Symphony.
- **Expand access to Best-in-Class non-IT service contracts** for highly qualified contractors by providing increased small business opportunities and an improved selling experience.
- **Encourage competition among services contractors** to provide best value mission outcomes.
- **Maximize small business participation** by removing barriers to entry and helping customer agencies acquire the best professional services solutions to meet their requirements.
