OASIS+ will use the [Symphony procurement suite tool](https://oasis.app.cloud.gov/), also referred to as the OASIS+ Submission Portal or OSP, for proposal submission, evaluations, and task order management. We have provided recorded trainings to walk you through system registration, proposal submission, and task order management.

All sellers who are interested in submitting proposals to the OASIS+ suite of contracts must register in Symphony. In order to register your business in Symphony you will need your company SAM or System for Award Management and Unique Entity ID or UEI.
