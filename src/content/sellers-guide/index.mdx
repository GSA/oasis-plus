        ### Determine if OASIS+ is the right contract for your business  
        Review the OASIS+ informational materials to ensure you understand the details and requirements of the contract.

        ### Research potential customers and competitors  
        Discover what domains best fit your business' services offerings and what government agencies are buying the services you sell; learn how agencies use your services, explore how you compare to other sellers, and discover subcontracting opportunities.

        ### Review solicitations    
        Review solicitations in SAM.gov; understanding the offer requirements will help you to decide which contract you should apply for.
