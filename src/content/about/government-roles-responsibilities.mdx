- Requiring Activity: The agency requesting services. When government agencies contract with each other, it’s an Interagency Agreement.
- Servicing Agency: The agency fulfilling the need.
- Ordering Contracting Officer, or OCO: The person who performs the acquisition. Sellers will primarily engage with the OCO as they complete their work.
