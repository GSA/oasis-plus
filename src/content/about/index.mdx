One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services Plus is a suite of governmentwide, multi-award contracts designed to support federal agencies’ procurement requirements for services-based solutions. 

## A streamlined program with expanded offerings

This suite of contracts combines the scope of legacy OASIS; Building, Maintenance &
Operations; and Human Capital & Training Solutions under one program, along with new areas of service that were previously not in scope. It expands the range of service offerings for buyers and gives sellers a greater variety of areas they can compete for.

OASIS+ will enable federal customers to acquire innovative solutions from highly qualified businesses on a contract vehicle designed to be [Best-in-Class or BIC:](https://acquisitiongateway.gov/Category-management/resources/4163) a governmentwide designation that satisfies key criteria defined by Office of Management and Budget which allows sellers to offer an expanded variety of services.

## Built for the Future 

OASIS+ represents a bold step by GSA to innovate on the successes and opportunities gleaned from the OASIS program over the years; drawing on these learnings, we are building a more robust suite of Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, or IDIQ contracts for the next generation of professional services solutions, that will be flexible enough to meet federal customers’ increasingly complex requirements.

### OASIS+ will:

- **Fulfill federal agencies' non-IT services requirements** through highly qualified contractors and a simpler buying experience: all task order management now happens through a single platform, Symphony.
- **Expand access to Best-in-Class non-IT service contracts** for highly qualified contractors by providing increased small business opportunities and an improved selling experience.
- **Encourage competition among services contractors** to provide best value mission outcomes.
- **Maximize small business participation** by removing barriers to entry and helping customer agencies acquire the best professional services solutions to meet their requirements.
