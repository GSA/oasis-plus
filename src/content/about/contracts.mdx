## Contract awards
The OASIS+ UR contracts were awarded as full and open competition. The OASIS+ SB contracts were awarded as 100% small business set-asides. The OASIS+ 8(a) program was awarded as a 100% set aside for exclusive competition among 8(a) participants, which was offered to and accepted by Small Business Administration (SBA) under SBA requirement number IX1685025756D; therefore, offer and acceptance has already been completed for competitive 8(a) task orders issued under OASIS+.  Reference Section 3.2.10.2.1 regarding requirements for offer and acceptance to SBA for sole source/direct 8(a) task order solicitations and awards.
