## Introduction
Thank you for choosing the OASIS+ family of contracts to fulfill your complex, integrated multiple service needs! This suite of services contracts is available for use by agencies throughout the Federal Government, as defined in Section 2.1, who hold a Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA), as referenced in Section 3.0.

The OASIS+ contracts provide a common architecture and platform across the Federal Government for the acquisition of a full range of service requirements that integrate multiple service disciplines and ancillary services/products with the flexibility for commercial and non-commercial requirements, all contract types and pricing determined at the task order level to achieve a total solution. 

This Ordering Guide explains how the OASIS+ contracts can be used to satisfy a wide variety of services requirements. It does not address general contracting issues or concepts unless necessary for complete understanding. Online resources supporting the use of OASIS+ are available on the General Service Administration's (GSA's) OASIS+ website and GSA's OASIS+ Interact site. This guide is to demonstrate just how easy OASIS+ makes the ordering process!
