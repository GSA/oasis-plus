The contract scope is organized by domains and North American Industry Classification System or NAICS codes.

**Domains:**

The contract scope is organized by domains or functional groupings of related services spanning multiple NAICs codes. Domains are designed to align order requirements to qualified industry partners. Each domain is limited to the NAICS codes and associated size standards specifically listed under that domain; if you’re buying or selling work related to this domain, it must tie back to the appropriate NAICS codes.

**NAICS codes:**

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the standard used by federal statistical agencies in classifying entity establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.
