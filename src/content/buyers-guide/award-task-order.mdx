## Proposal evaluation considerations

OCOs should evaluate proposals based on the methodology stated in the task order solicitation to maintain fairness in the ordering process and mitigate protest risk. The following factors should all be taken into account as part of this process:

### Price

The OCO is responsible for analyzing task order proposals and documenting their cost or price analysis to include a determination that the final agreed-upon price is fair and reasonable at the task order level. To the maximum extent practicable, price analysis should be based on competition.

**OASIS+ Master Contract Ceiling Rates:** Except for sole source T&M/LH orders as detailed in [Pricing and wage rates] (/buyers-guide/research-contract-features/pricing-wage-rates) in accordance with [FAR 16.505(b)(3)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.505), price rates are determined fair and reasonable at the task order level.

### Evaluation Factors

In accordance with [FAR 16.505(b)(1)(ii)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.505), “The contracting officer may exercise broad discretion in developing appropriate order placement procedures. The contracting officer should keep submission requirements to a minimum. Contracting officers may use streamlined procedures, including oral presentations.”

The source selection procedures in [FAR Part 15.3](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-15.3) do not apply when using the procedures of FAR 16.505 Ordering (when providing for fair opportunity). The task order solicitation and award process should be as streamlined as practical to reduce solicitation and proposal preparation costs and time for both the government and contractor.

## Task order award considerations
OCOs are required to use Symphony to report award information for any task orders awarded under OASIS+. Symphony task order solicitation methodology information is available at Develop and Issue the solicitation [buyers-guide/develop-issue-task-order-solicitation]. Symphony will require the reporting of information not collected as part of the solicitation process that is known only upon award of a task order. OCOs accepting proposals via Symphony and issuing award notices via Symphony will benefit from having less information to report than OCO’s who accept proposals and issue awards external to Symphony. 

OCOs are requested to verify solicitation information input into Symphony, and correct as needed, prior to reporting any award information. Information required to be reported in Symphony includes:
- Task order number
- Awarded contractor’s name
- Awarded contractor’s Unique Entity IDentifier (UEID)
- Task order award date
- Period of Performance beginning and estimated ultimate completion dates
- Initial obligated dollar value
- Total estimated value
- Commercial or noncommercial type task order
- FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting included at the task order level

### Public Notice of Awards with Exceptions to Fair Opportunity

For orders based on an exception to fair opportunity, in accordance with [FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.505), the OCO must post the required public notice within 14 days after placing the order. If exception (A) (urgency-unacceptable delay) is used, the public notice must be posted within 30 days after placing the order. This posting requirement includes posting the justification approved for the exception at the [System for Award Management](https://sam.gov/content/home). 

Note the actions excluded from this notice requirement are:
- Disclosures that would compromise national security, and
- Socioeconomic set-asides authorized by [FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.505).

### Task Order Level Protests

Task order protests are the responsibility of the specific agency which solicited the task order (GSA is only responsible for GSA-solicited task order protests.) [FAR 16.505 (a)(10)](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/16.505) prohibits protests under [FAR subpart 33.1](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-33.1) in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of task orders or delivery order contract, except for:

- A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period of performance, or maximum value of the contract; or
- For agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, a protest of an order valued in excess of $10 million ([41 U.S.C. 4106(f)](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title41-section4106(f)&num=0&edition=prelim)); or
- For DoD, NASA, or the Coast Guard, a protest of an order valued in excess of $25 million ([10 U.S.C. 3406(f) [PDF, 3 pages]](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3406)).

### NAICS Code Appeals
The OASIS+ NAICS code chosen by the OCO from [NAICS codes by domain](/about/domains-naicscodes-scope-labor-categories/naics-codes/) representing the principal purpose of a task order may be appealed in accordance with [FAR 19.103](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.103).  

### Ombudsman

In accordance with [GSAM/R 516.505 (b)](https://www.acquisition.gov/gsam/516.505): The [GSA Task Order and Delivery Order Ombudsman](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/gsa-ombudsman) shall review and resolve complaints from contractors concerning all task and delivery order actions made by GSA.

Complaints regarding task and delivery order actions of other agencies using GSA contract vehicles shall be directed to the ordering agency’s Task Order and Delivery Order Ombudsman. For orders issued by any other ordering activity, refer to the agency specific Ombudsman.

### Reporting Task Order Awards in FPDS
Contract actions are reported in the FPDS within three (3) days after execution of the action. It is important that each OASIS+ task order is reported as an order under the respective OASIS+ master contract number. Each OASIS+ contractor may have multiple OASIS+ contract numbers depending on how many IDIQ contracts they were awarded.  

Double check that the FPDS report accurately reflects the appropriate values in all fields, in particular those related to award data, fair opportunity procedures used, and number of offers received.

The FPDS system will propagate the NAICS code field in the task order action report with the NAICS code reported for the indefinite delivery vehicle (IDV, i.e., IDIQ) contract. Refer to [Domains, NAICS codes, scope and labor categories](/about/domains-naicscodes-scope-labor-categories/) for additional information.
