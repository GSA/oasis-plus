The following information is related to researching contract features – specifically, those that focus on prohibitions.

## Scope and services not allowed

OASIS+ task orders must NOT include any of the following:
- Any requirement for inherently governmental functions as defined in **FAR 2.101**.
- Any requirement for personal services as defined in **FAR 2.101**.
- Any requirement whose principal purpose — as determined by the OCO — falls under the scope of [FAR part 36 — Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-36). This does not preclude use of architects and engineers for services not required to be under FAR part 36 such as construction management, etc.
- Any requirement whose principal purpose — as determined by the OCO — is in a NAICS code not listed under the corresponding domain solicited. 

## Prohibited actions against or under OASIS+ contracts

Blanket purchase agreements: **No IDIQ or BPA may be issued against any OASIS+ contract.**

Agencies may not issue an IDIQ order instrument or BPA against the OASIS+ IDIQ contracts (see [Harris IT Services Corporation B-411699,B-411796: Oct 2, 2015](https://www.gao.gov/products/b-411699%2Cb-411796#mt%3De-report)). However, considerable flexibility with respect to variable levels of effort and requirements can be achieved through the use of optional CLINs, T&M/LH CLINs, and cost-reimbursement type CLINs (e.g., issuing a not to exceed cost-reimbursement type order with a wide scope that is incrementally funded via “Technical Direction Letters” within the scope of the task order). OCOs seeking further guidance on these flexibilities are encouraged to submit a scope review outlining the desired flexibility.

**Small business set asides: No further set-asides may be issued under any OASIS+ contract.**

OASIS+ includes five SB contracts: OASIS+ UR, OASIS+ SB, OASIS+ 8(a), OASIS+ WOSB, OASIS+ HUBZone, and OASIS+ SDVOSB that were awarded as 100% small business set-asides. Further setting aside to a subset of small businesses under any OASIS+ contract is prohibited. While small businesses may hold an OASIS+ UR contract, it is explicitly prohibited to issue any small business set-aside task order solicitations under OASIS+ UR. Additionally, for example, it is expressly prohibited to issue an economically disadvantaged women-owned small business set-aside under OASIS+ WOSB.

**Prohibited action: No issuance of a task order solicitation to multiple OASIS+ contracts, OASIS+ domains or NAICS codes simultaneously.**  
An OCO may NOT issue a solicitation to multiple OASIS+ contracts at the same time (e.g., issuing the same solicitation to the OASIS+ UR contract under the Management and Advisory Domain with NAICS code 541611 and the OASIS+ SB contract under the management and advisory domain with NAICS code 541611 simultaneously is prohibited), nor multiple domains at the same time (e.g., issuing the same solicitation to the technical and engineering domain and environmental services domain), nor multiple NAICS codes at the same time (e.g., issuing the same solicitation to NAICS code 541330 and NAICS code 541715). 

**Prohibited action: No new awards of a task order to a contractor in dormant status.** See [Working with contractors in dormant status](/buyers-guide/develop-issue-task-order-solicitation/#contractors-in-dormant-status) for more information.
