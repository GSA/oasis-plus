Symphony is a full lifecycle procurement software as a service (SaaS) that allows government organizations to manage complex contracts. It ensures organizations are purchasing according to fair opportunity laws and rules, and provides users increased transparency and integrity at both the master contract level and task order level. It is home to the OASIS+ submission portal, which buyers will use to issue, manage, and award task orders.
